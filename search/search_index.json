The increasing use of data in the field of SSH has allowed for more diversity in approaches to research questions, as well as broaden the possible range of questions that can be asked. However, historical data used in SSH research is by nature overwhelmed by biases, impacted by the author\u2019s positionality and context, producing problematic language and categorisations. The complexity of this issue in the field of SSH lies within the fact that these skewed perspectives cannot simply be replaced with less biased alternatives (a \u2018rewriting\u2019 of the archives). Instead, we believe it is the responsibility of the dataset creators to critically reflect on the biases of the source data, and to acknowledge, contextualise and inform users about these. Combatting Bias underlines the necessity for responsible and transparent strategies to navigate these biases. Thus, we aim to create lasting and flexible handholds for dataset creators to guide them in this process. </p> <p>We will therefore produce a set of guidelines for data creation that we call FAIR+. These guidelines will be rooted in the existing FAIR principles, aimed at developing a technically sustainable data creation process; combined with crucial ethical considerations enmeshed in the field of SSH, which have become more pronounced as the field increasingly uses digital infrastructures to support and enable research. This encourages the creation of documentation and datasheets that critically and transparently reflect on our data and data curation practices. In line with the FAIR+ guidelines, we will additionally create reusable templates that can be used for ethical data documentation. Through this, we not only hope to establish an ethical and sustainable framework for future data collection and curation, but also encourage that different, less represented data is collected. </p>"},{"location":"about/mission/#network-of-expertise","title":"Network of expertise","text":"<p>Combatting Bias is a collaborative project.

The project is primarily aimed at dataset creators working in the field of SSH, practically providing guidance in the process of creating ethical historical data. The ethical data will be transparent about skewed categorisations and language the historical sources used, resulting in the prevention of the perpetuation of these (harmful) biases in the future reiterations of the data. Furthermore, it will allow current researchers to reconsider concepts in their data, reading it \u2018against the grain\u2019, and gain insight into different narratives and perspectives their historical data contains as well as which are lacking - this stimulates new research ventures. </p> <p>We, however, hope to make a broader impact than only within SSH research circles. In line with the efforts within the humanities towards decolonisation of knowledge, academia, and cultural heritage (institutions), Combatting Bias focusses these efforts on digital heritage. The project is therefore engaging in issues that may interest heritage specialists and institutions, inclusion and diversity activists, archivists among others. The general public too, as direct users of historical datasets through archives (Nationaal Archief) for example, or indirect users, such as reading articles or watching documentaries basing themselves on historical datasets, can find interest in the project. </p> <p>Can projects that are not partnered with Combatting Bias get in touch for guidance and advise about creating fair and ethical data?  Yes!

Balancing Openness and Sensitivity","text":"<p>First, we all agreed that datasets should adhere to the FAIR principles. This makes the data easy to search and use for both humans and computers.

Diverse Perspectives are Essential","text":"<p>Lastly, we talked about the need to include diverse perspectives in our work. Participants highlighted that bias often stems from a lack of diversity in these processes. Even well-documented datasets can be problematic if they rely solely on Dutch or Anglophone sources, potentially missing crucial perspectives from the people central to the historical narratives. Colonial archives present additional challenges, such as westernised spellings of names and places. This not only misrepresents the original information, but also makes the data harder to find without alternative spellings. It is therefore crucial to include not only a wider range of secondary literature from different regions, but also to consult people who are language and culture experts on the region the source is describing. </p> <p>The group activity itself, with its many participants examining the data from various angles, was a case in point.

The necessity of acknowledging the historian in scholarship","text":"<p>Written by Amber Zijlma</p> <p>Positionality and bias are interconnected. In this series of blog posts, we share our thoughts on positionality by reflecting on experiences we\u2019ve had with it in our own work.</p> <p>As a history student at a British university, I was discouraged from including the personal pronoun \u2018I\u2019 in my essays. Instead, a more impersonal \u2018we\u2019, or more preferably \u2018this essay\u2019, were to be used. This seems to be the general rule of thumb for (English) academic writing, inferred from the many writing guides titled something along the lines of \u2018Using personal pronouns in writing\u2019.<sup>1</sup> University writing guides agree that the \u2018I\u2019 is recommended only when the assignment is reflexive or when a personal experience is explicitly relevant to the piece of writing. </p> <p>While it is very valid that the \u2018I\u2019 sometimes just makes sentences more complicated and less easy to read, I think much of the reasoning for avoiding this personal pronoun is to present some form of objectivity to a paper. Objectivity is then associated with authority, believability, and legitimacy within academia. Some writing guides touch on this point that the \u2018I\u2019 highlights the author\u2019s position within the research - and that this is not always wanted or necessary. </p> <p>My point here is, however, that the author\u2019s position - the \u2018I\u2019 - is always relevant.<sup>2</sup> Subjectivity is inherent to writing, researching, and just existing, really. Not being able to acknowledge an author\u2019s positionality, their identity and context and narrative, means feigning objectivity (an \u2018unbiased\u2019 history) that doesn\u2019t exist. And this is a much bigger issue that goes beyond whether or not the use of \u2018I\u2019 is \u2018good academic practice\u2019.   </p> <p>I find it quite ironic, because historians are acutely aware of the significance of positionality. We spend much of our research time on critically analysing the significance of the author\u2019s background of (primary) sources, so to understand in what way we should read the source itself. Expressing our own identities, however, is heavily discouraged, whether it is through the use of \u2018I\u2019 or personal anecdotes in our writing. </p> <p>Admittedly, I too believed for a long time that my writing had to be as impersonal as I could make it. That was until I was writing up a blog post for an internship I was doing, and my internship supervisor prompted me to specifically include why I chose to write about the topic I had researched. The project<sup>3</sup> I was a part of conducted research into World War II photographs of Jewish people in the Netherlands, and I had come across a photograph taken in my hometown, Apeldoorn. It was taken in an area I had passed many times, without ever being aware of the history behind it - I felt ashamed for my unknowing, and this drove me to write something about this history. Acknowledging my presence in the narrative, made the writing more immediate, urgent, and transparent.<sup>4</sup> </p> <p>This adds to what my internship supervisor told me: that much of the history writing on resistances is grounded in activism, writers overtly merging their identities as historians and activists, often not out of sole interest but necessity.<sup>5</sup> There is therefore power in this self-reflection in research: not only does it show self-awareness to the reader; it can also strengthen the research, because the author\u2019s identity adds their lived experiences to their writing, providing depth and perspective. </p> <p>This is especially important, because history itself is a collection of multiple perspectives and interpretations of the past, sometimes contradictory, that exist alongside each other.<sup>6</sup> The reluctance to present a historical narrative in a way that acknowledges the human nature of its writing, is therefore damaging to knowledge production, as it contradicts the essence of history itself: a plurivocal narrative of the past. And so, these perspectives need to be clearly laid out to be able to facilitate transparent discussions about history. </p> <p>I think including the \u2018I\u2019 is one way to openly acknowledge biases that are present in an author\u2019s positionality. There is power in this recognition, as well as value in enabling transparent discussion. History writing, after all, is inherently subjective, and consequently, history itself consists of (opposing) narratives and experiences. Understanding the human nature of this is crucial - only then can we properly reflect on biases present in historical research and navigate them effectively.</p> <p> </p> <p>  Figures 1 and 2: I am here!
