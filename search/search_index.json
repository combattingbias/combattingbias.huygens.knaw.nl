We embrace this responsibility through a set of ethical commitments that ensure accountability in our work.</p> <p>Born from the GLOBALISE project, Combatting Bias emerged in response to challenges and experiences encountered in building datasets and digital infrastructures. Our ethical commitments supplement and extend GLOBALISE\u2019s Ethics Policy by specifically addressing institutional and systemic injustices, and the two should be read in conjunction.</p> <ol> <li> <p>We acknowledge that archival materials have (historically) not been described in a way that enables access to the stories of the minoritised. We are committed to centering the humanity of minoritised groups in all aspects of our work. </p> </li> <li> <p>We acknowledge that archives often describe minoritised groups with harmful and offensive language, and can bear narratives of violence and oppression inflicted on these groups. We are committed to thinking about ways people can access these archives in safer ways. </p> </li> <li> <p>We acknowledge that knowledge production is inherently influenced by power structures, with academic standards historically shaped by Global North institutions that have (in)directly benefited from the appropriation of indigenous knowledge and resources. Our core project team is based in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, in the Global North, and we therefore acknowledge that this brings inherent biases to our work. Our commitment is twofold: to actively amplify diverse perspectives in our work and to maintain transparency in our decision-making processes. We believe research must be grounded in and accountable to the communities it affects, particularly centering the voices and experiences of those most impacted. Through our global network of partners and advisors, we maintain deep connections both within our Dutch communities and internationally, enabling us to integrate a rich diversity of perspectives and lived experiences into our work.</p> </li> <li> <p>We acknowledge that working with data risks having a reductionist impact on peoples\u2019 experiences and identities. We are committed to creating human-centred descriptions and providing caring context. </p> </li> <li> <p>We acknowledge that decolonisation and reparation are unfinished endeavours, and will not be completed during this project. We are committed to working with experts and activists and remaining open-minded during and after the completion of this project to adjust to shifting narratives and needs of minoritised communities. </p> </li> <li> <p>Our research recognizes that while computational tools and AI offer valuable capabilities for analysing historical data within SSH, they can amplify existing inequities. Digital technologies often create a cycle of \u201ccoded bias\u201d<sup>1</sup> where minoritised communities face compounded discrimination through biased training data, opaque systems, labor exploitation, environmental harm, and concentrated corporate power. We address this through developing responsible data curation standards and engaging in AI policy advocacy. While we see AI\u2019s potential benefits, we maintain a critical stance - supporting beneficial applications while opposing harmful ones, recognizing that AI should serve community needs rather than be treated as inevitable.</p> </li> <li> <p>We believe in democratising access to knowledge. Our commitment to accessibility means publishing all our work through open access channels and ensuring our research outputs are freely available. </p> </li> </ol> <p>With these ethical commitments, we join a culture of previous projects committed to producing ethical and just research. We drew inspirations from these projects before us, such as, but not limited to, HIA Collection, On The Grounds, and the Rozsa Foundation. We are committed to continuously update our knowledge (and therefore, our ethical commitments) on the issues of decoloniality, fair inclusion and representation, and responsible AI use.</p> <p>Explanation of Terms</p> <ul> <li> <p>With minoritised peoples we refer to individuals or groups negatively affected by inequalities created through colonialism, exploitation, and/or discrimination. Following D\u2019Ignazio and Klein (2020)<sup>2</sup>, we prefer this term to \u2018marginalised\u2019 or \u2018minorities\u2019. \u2018Marginalised\u2019 implies a misleading binary between \u2018core\u2019 and \u2018margin\u2019, when these spaces are actually fluid and intersectional. \u2018Minorities\u2019 defines people primarily by their oppression. In contrast, \u2018minoritisation\u2019 emphasizes the process and experience of oppression, acknowledging the humanity of those facing unjust circumstances.</p> </li> <li> <p>The term Global North, though potentially dated, refers to regions where power and wealth have historically been\u2014and continue to be\u2014concentrated. In our project\u2019s context, these are primarily regions that engaged in imperialist conquests and violent exploitation, such as Western Europe and North America. While we acknowledge the problematic dichotomy with \u2018Global South\u2019 and recognize that neither region is monolithic, we use \u2018Global North\u2019 as a practical shorthand. It helps us identify areas that gained disproportionate power and wealth through the historically unjust distribution of resources (via exploitation and extraction), in contrast to regions that suffered this violence.<sup>4</sup></p> </li> </ul> <ol> <li> <p>Ressa, Maria. 2025. \u201cOutlook: AI and Media.\u201d Presented at the International Association for Safe &amp; Ethical AI, Paris, February 6. https://www.iaseai.org/conference/program/outlook-ai-and-media.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>D\u2019ignazio, Catherine, and Lauren F.

The increasing use of data in the field of SSH has allowed for more diversity in approaches to research questions, as well as broaden the possible range of questions that can be asked. However, historical data used in SSH research is by nature overwhelmed by biases, impacted by the author\u2019s positionality and context, producing problematic language and categorisations. The complexity of this issue in the field of SSH lies within the fact that these skewed perspectives cannot simply be replaced with less biased alternatives (a \u2018rewriting\u2019 of the archives). Instead, we believe it is the responsibility of the dataset creators to critically reflect on the biases of the source data, and to acknowledge, contextualise and inform users about these.

Fortunately, as a historian of the Dutch East India Company (Vereenigde Oost Indische Compagnie, hereafter VOC), there is quite literally a sea of written archives that I can gleefully dive into to find pearls of information that I can string together to make the histories I write. As we might all be aware, this archive only offers a perspective of the past. The VOC entered the Indian Ocean World as a prospective trader in 1602 and established settlements and exercised varying levels of power and authority in territories of differing sizes in this maritime zone. Deploying the archives of the VOC for historical research warrants critically reflecting numerous avenues through which bias can manifest itself in the archive. It also calls on us to responsibly navigate these biases by looking within, and beyond the VOC archives. Such careful consideration of the core materials of our craft is necessary such that we can productively use these archives to write histories of both the VOC and the places, states, and people that were written about in these archives. In writing this blogpost, I do not purport to have answers or solutions for the biases that I enumerate. On the contrary, I intend to lay down a series of issues that historians of the VOC will encounter and need to inevitably ruminate about. </p>  Brush drawing of a man, possibly Brandes himself, reading on the windowsill of probably the VOC ship Stavenisse on the route Batavia - Ceylon - Cape of Good Hope.

Historians have argued that the view that this archive takes of the maritime world often manifested in the form of derogatory and patronizing characterizations of societies, religions, and cultures they encountered. Religions like Hinduism and Buddhism were presented as devilish and vile, governments were projected as despotic, and persons who opposed the ambitions of the company were projected as untrustworthy, selfish, and arrogant. Historians have learned to navigate these characterizations, as value-laden interpretations that were not representative of a reality. They have come to recognize these perspectives as revealing of the prejudices, anxieties, fears, and ambitions of the observers.<sup>1</sup>  Yet, at the same time, it is important to recognize that the archive is not all fiction and all Foucauldian discourse. While these layers of interpretation are key to studying our sources, and how contemporary observers wrote about their present, it should still be possible to peel away the layers of interpretation to reveal historical occurrences.<sup>2</sup> </p>"},{"location":"news/historicalbias/#the-presentist-bias","title":"The Presentist Bias","text":"<p>Present-day concerns invariably determine what facets of the past historians seek to study, and how they interpret the sources they analyse. Social movements in the last century such as the movement for gender equality have for instance generated interest in themes such as the history of gender and post-colonialism as a political condition in the past century generated an interest in subaltern histories, and histories of resistance.<sup>3</sup> These topical themes of the twentieth and subsequently the twenty-first centuries were almost unheard of in the period that predated this phase. We can, without a sliver of doubt, in the aforementioned trends see that interests and perspectives strongly rooted in present day culture and political movements can be vastly beneficial in initiating inquiry into and shedding light on previously understudied themes. On the other hand, anachronism or imputing present day understandings of concepts into the past can be a problem. Historians need to acknowledge the fact that the past is indeed a foreign country.<sup>4</sup> How we understand ethnicity and race in the present day starkly differs from, for instance, how these concepts were understood by the VOC. \u2018European\u2019 was not necessarily understood as a racial category, but more as a social one. No example can illustrate this argument better than the recruitment and appointment of Jan van Velsen, to the position of Dutch commander at the court, who is described in the VOC records as \u201cdark-skinned and born of a Javanese mother.\u201d<sup>5</sup> This instance forces us to take a long hard look at how we comprehend Europeanness in the context of the Dutch East India Company, who we understand as being the employees of the VOC, and the interracial unions which were very much a reality in Dutch settlements like Batavia. </p>"},{"location":"news/historicalbias/#the-embarrassment-of-riches","title":"\u201cThe Embarrassment of Riches\u201d<sup>6</sup>","text":"<p>The Dutch East India Company has left behind an obscenely voluminous archive. While on one hand, especially with regards to the English-speaking world, and those territories in maritime Asia where the VOC enjoyed a presence, it is befitting to complain about the underutilization of the archives to study histories. On the other hand, in contexts where the VOC archives have been researched and utilized, I have often wondered how this mammoth archive has influenced the historical conclusions we arrive at. Have the Dutch East India Company\u2019s penchant for record keeping, and the fact that a large part of these records have survived the exegesis of time impacted history writing? In other words, are the VOC overrepresented in histories of early modern maritime Asia? Have these archives led to historians misjudging the strength of Dutch shipping in relation to local trade? Has it led to historians overstating the presence of the VOC and in some regions, overemphasizing the colonial role and impact of the VOC? Historians of the VOC have often sought to balance out their overreliance on the VOC archive, with recourse to other European archives like the English, French, and Portuguese, and archives of other regions and empires such as Mughal, Japanese, or Javanese. More often than not, seeking recourse to alternative source material (that can also be scientific or archaeological and the like) can often be unbalanced and weighted almost entirely in favour of the VOC archives owing to its vastness. </p>"},{"location":"news/historicalbias/#downsides-of-digitization","title":"Downsides of Digitization","text":"<p>Just as we carefully consider and craft solutions for dealing with these very relevant and real issues, the digitalization of the Dutch East India Company archives has flung new challenges into the mix. While previously historians had to visit archival institutions such as the National Archives in the Hague in person and pore over archival documents for days and months on end, scanned and transcribed versions of the documents can now be perused online anywhere in the world free of change. On one hand, this accessibility radically tears down biases, in terms of who previously could and who can now access and read these archives.<sup>7</sup> On the other hand, it raises new questions as to how increased accessibility of the VOC archives can result in the overutilization of the digitized VOC archives at the expense of other local archives.

Even well-documented datasets can be problematic if they rely solely on Dutch or Anglophone sources, potentially missing crucial perspectives from the people central to the historical narratives. Colonial archives present additional challenges, such as westernised spellings of names and places.

As a result, they contain many biases. Digitizing these collections and making them searchable through Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) is therefore insufficient. In developing infrastructures it is important to find ways to highlight these biases, counter them where possible and help people navigate them, to be able to explore all of the riches these archives have to offer. To celebrate the inaugural lecture of our project leader Matthias van Rossum on January 24th 2025, GLOBALISE co-organized a symposium to critically reflect on this very theme of Colonial Archives and Meaningful Digital Infrastructures. In the course of four panels that were organized, speakers from diverse fields \u2013 historians, digital humanists, artists, archivists, and representatives from the heritage sector \u2013 together with attendees on site in Nijmegen and online discussed how to undertake this task in a meaningful and ethical way, and reflected on the challenges and opportunities that come with it. </p> <p>Following the opening statements by Liedeke Plate, professor of Culture and Inclusivity and director of the Radboud Institute for Culture and History, and Matthias van Rossum, the first panel focused on the worldwide relevance of colonial archives and the potential of digitally unlocking them. </p> <p>Moderated by heritage specialist and historian Wim Manuhutu, the panellists stressed the importance of access to colonial archives for communities from former colonies and of involving them in developing infrastructures to make them accessible. Nadeera Rupesinghe, the director general of the National Archives of Sri Lanka, highlighted the vital role that colonial archives play in current issues surrounding land ownership in Sri Lanka. Creative producer and visual artist Wisaal Abrahams considered the potential of using the archives to create narratives and experiences that initiate a joint agreement about what colonialism is. Historians Margo Groenewoud and Nancy Jouwe respectively stressed the importance of involving communities in contextualizing colonial archives and treating them as equal stakeholders while doing so.</p> <p>The second panel, moderated by GLOBALISE\u2019s project manager Lodewijk Petram, focused on what follows after collections have been made searchable by generating transcriptions: how to create meaningful infrastructures? What first became clear from the panel is the value of bringing different archival collections together. Professor Hylkje de Jong, leader of the HUF project, showed how connecting court records that were created in the early modern Dutch Republic to colonial archives can lead to a better and more expansive understanding of the past. Community manager of WO2net and Onsland Thomas van Maaren showed what bringing together different archival collections looks like in practice by discussing three platforms (Oorlogsbronnen, Onsland and Oorlog voor de Rechter) thereby highlighting the importance of contextualisation and user-friendliness. Brecht Nijman and Kay Pepping, GLOBALISE researchers, discussed different ways in which GLOBALISE provides contextualization to the part of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) archives it works with: through detecting and identifying entities and events, and the creation of reference data and a thesaurus.</p>"},{"location":"news/meaningfulinfrastructuresforcolonialarchives/#addressing-bias-and-contextualization-in-digital-infrastructures","title":"Addressing Bias and Contextualization in Digital Infrastructures","text":"<p>After a lunch break, the symposium continued with a panel about bias in the archive as a challenge and a source, moderated by Lodewijk Petram.

Britt van Duijvenvoorde and Pascal Konings of the Exploring Slave Trade in Asia (ESTA) project explained how they try to map and visualize the characterizations of slavery in Asia to make room for people who have systematically been marginalized. GLOBALISE researchers Dung Pham and Henrike Vellinga talked about the project\u2019s dataset on ethnicities, religious groups and castes that contextualizes (often problematic and harmful) terms from the archive to help users find marginalized groups in the archive while still alerting them to the problematic meaning of this terminology and why it is derogatory.

Manjusha Kuruppath, team lead at GLOBALISE, reflected on which groups will benefit from the archival accessibility facilitated by the project. Historian Luc Bulten highlighted the need for infrastructural transparency whereby users are made aware of the choices that are made in creating these infrastructures. According to Bulten, users should be told which (parts of) archival collections have been digitized and where they can find other relevant non-digitized collections. </p> <p>Historian Mark Ponte and sociologist Stephanie Welvaart focused on reaching new audiences by allowing people to add personal stories to colonial archives. Ponte talked about inviting communities to share their views and knowledge about history and to co-create presentations like exhibitions, documentaries and websites, thereby constructing new narratives. Welvaart expressed the need to create a space for emotions where people can describe and share what it means for them to read about the history they are or feel connected to, and to place these stories next to the archival material itself.</p> <p>The principal message that was echoed by various speakers in the symposium was the vital need to involve different stakeholders \u2013 from researchers to people from the former colonies \u2013 in creating meaningful digital infrastructures for unlocking colonial archives. It was reiterated that the colonial archives need to be contextualized in a way that does justice to the past and offers the means to explore its contents in accordance with today\u2019s needs. In doing so, projects and persons have to be transparent about the choices they make when creating digital infrastructures and highlight the biases that are present or still persist in the archives, and parts of the infrastructure. This ensures that users are entrusted with all the information they need to be able to use the digitized colonial archives ethically, responsibly and optimally. After all, the colonial archives hold a wide range of meanings for different people and communities. They should not only serve as a useful source for historical research but can also be a deeply personal window into the pasts of individuals and societies, revealing how colonialism shaped the past and present.</p>"},{"location":"news/positionality/","title":"\u2018I\u2019 am here! The necessity of acknowledging the historian in scholarship","text":"<p>Written by Amber Zijlma</p> <p>Positionality and bias are interconnected. In this series of blog posts, we share our thoughts on positionality by reflecting on experiences we\u2019ve had with it in our own work.</p> <p>As a history student at a British university, I was discouraged from including the personal pronoun \u2018I\u2019 in my essays. Instead, a more impersonal \u2018we\u2019, or more preferably \u2018this essay\u2019, were to be used. This seems to be the general rule of thumb for (English) academic writing, inferred from the many writing guides titled something along the lines of \u2018Using personal pronouns in writing\u2019.<sup>1</sup> University writing guides agree that the \u2018I\u2019 is recommended only when the assignment is reflexive or when a personal experience is explicitly relevant to the piece of writing. </p> <p>While it is very valid that the \u2018I\u2019 sometimes just makes sentences more complicated and less easy to read, I think much of the reasoning for avoiding this personal pronoun is to present some form of objectivity to a paper. Objectivity is then associated with authority, believability, and legitimacy within academia. Some writing guides touch on this point that the \u2018I\u2019 highlights the author\u2019s position within the research - and that this is not always wanted or necessary. </p> <p>My point here is, however, that the author\u2019s position - the \u2018I\u2019 - is always relevant.<sup>2</sup> Subjectivity is inherent to writing, researching, and just existing, really. Not being able to acknowledge an author\u2019s positionality, their identity and context and narrative, means feigning objectivity (an \u2018unbiased\u2019 history) that doesn\u2019t exist. And this is a much bigger issue that goes beyond whether or not the use of \u2018I\u2019 is \u2018good academic practice\u2019.   </p> <p>I find it quite ironic, because historians are acutely aware of the significance of positionality. We spend much of our research time on critically analysing the significance of the author\u2019s background of (primary) sources, so to understand in what way we should read the source itself. Expressing our own identities, however, is heavily discouraged, whether it is through the use of \u2018I\u2019 or personal anecdotes in our writing. </p> <p>Admittedly, I too believed for a long time that my writing had to be as impersonal as I could make it. That was until I was writing up a blog post for an internship I was doing, and my internship supervisor prompted me to specifically include why I chose to write about the topic I had researched. The project<sup>3</sup> I was a part of conducted research into World War II photographs of Jewish people in the Netherlands, and I had come across a photograph taken in my hometown, Apeldoorn. It was taken in an area I had passed many times, without ever being aware of the history behind it - I felt ashamed for my unknowing, and this drove me to write something about this history. Acknowledging my presence in the narrative, made the writing more immediate, urgent, and transparent.<sup>4</sup> </p> <p>This adds to what my internship supervisor told me: that much of the history writing on resistances is grounded in activism, writers overtly merging their identities as historians and activists, often not out of sole interest but necessity.<sup>5</sup> There is therefore power in this self-reflection in research: not only does it show self-awareness to the reader; it can also strengthen the research, because the author\u2019s identity adds their lived experiences to their writing, providing depth and perspective. </p> <p>This is especially important, because history itself is a collection of multiple perspectives and interpretations of the past, sometimes contradictory, that exist alongside each other.<sup>6</sup> The reluctance to present a historical narrative in a way that acknowledges the human nature of its writing, is therefore damaging to knowledge production, as it contradicts the essence of history itself: a plurivocal narrative of the past. And so, these perspectives need to be clearly laid out to be able to facilitate transparent discussions about history. </p> <p>I think including the \u2018I\u2019 is one way to openly acknowledge biases that are present in an author\u2019s positionality. There is power in this recognition, as well as value in enabling transparent discussion. History writing, after all, is inherently subjective, and consequently, history itself consists of (opposing) narratives and experiences. Understanding the human nature of this is crucial - only then can we properly reflect on biases present in historical research and navigate them effectively.</p> <p> </p> <p>  Figures 1 and 2: I am here!

The VOC Data Experience sought to engage museum audiences with this complex past, encouraging them to reflect critically by exploring the company\u2019s historical data. Our goal was not to dictate narratives but to present raw data in compelling visualizations, allowing visitors to discover stories and form their own interpretations. However, as we delved deeper into the project, we encountered the limitations and biases within the three major datasets that we used:</p> <ol> <li>VOC Opvarenden: A dataset of 774,200 VOC payroll records, published by the Dutch National Archives.</li> <li>Dutch-Asiatic Shipping (DAS): Data on VOC voyages between Europe and Asia, published by the Huygens Institute.</li> <li>Bookkeeper General Batavia (BGB): Records of trade through Batavia (now Jakarta), also published by the Huygens Institute.</li> </ol> <p>Each dataset, though rich, is shaped by the biases inherent in the VOC\u2019s administrative machinery. These datasets exist because the VOC meticulously documented aspects of its operations aligned with its bureaucratic and commercial priorities, and these documents were subsequently preserved in the archives. For example, the VOC Opvarenden dataset reflects the payroll system, including only European crew, while ignoring the many Asian workers crucial to the VOC\u2019s operations. Similarly, the BGB dataset omits private trade by VOC personnel (which was permitted to some extent), VOC trade bypassing Batavia, and, crucially, trade conducted by Asian merchants on the same routes. These gaps highlight how the VOC\u2019s perspective\u2014rooted in its administrative priorities\u2014frames what is visible in the data and what remains obscured. This perspective has also shaped the creation of datasets and the focus of researchers, with disproportionate attention given to topics like Dutch shipping, largely due to its overrepresentation in existing sources and datasets.

And with just three minutes of audio for each experience, we had to guide visitors through the explanations while also addressing the biases, silences, and limitations inherent in the datasets.</p> <p>Even though I was already familiar with these datasets, collaborating with experts from diverse backgrounds brought fresh perspectives, uncovering biases and gaps I hadn\u2019t previously noticed. For instance, one of the topics we explored in an experience was women in the service of the VOC. This was based on records from the VOC Opvarenden dataset, which document cases where individuals were removed from service upon being identified as women, as noted in the original pay books. While I had thought about how these situations might have been handled, I hadn\u2019t deeply questioned the nature of these records. Dyonna Benett, however, did.
