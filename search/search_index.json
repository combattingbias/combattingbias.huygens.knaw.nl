Rather than pursuing the impossible goal of complete bias elimination, this project provides guidelines for researchers to understand and transparently document biases. While predominantly focused on historical data, the framework provides a broad scope for any researcher or user to think about issues of bias in their work.</p> <p>Bias Maps created by workshop participants</p> Combatting Bias Toolkit <p>The framework provides a broad scope for any researcher or user to think about issues of bias in their work.</p> Toolkit Vocabulary <p>Browse the bias vocabulary to establish a shared terminology across disciplines.</p> Vocabulary Dataset Lifecycle <p>See where and how bias emerges at different stages of dataset creation and use.</p> Lifecycle <p></p> Ethical Commitments <p>Our mission to reduce harmful bias carries significant responsibility for research integrity and ethics.</p> Ethical Commitments Bias(ed) Maps <p>When many people come together to think about the question  what is bias?: an activity in cutting and pasting.</p> Bias(ed) Maps Blog Posts <p>Newest: When Archives Break Hearts by Asawari Luthra</p> Read more! <p>Combatting Bias is funded by the Dutch Research Council (NWO) via the  Thematic Digital Competence Centre Social Sciences &amp; Humanities (TDCC-SSH)    Follow us on LinkedIn!

We embrace this responsibility through a set of ethical commitments that ensure accountability in our work.</p> <p>Born from the GLOBALISE project, Combatting Bias emerged in response to challenges and experiences encountered in building datasets and digital infrastructures. Our ethical commitments supplement and extend GLOBALISE\u2019s Ethics Policy by specifically addressing institutional and systemic injustices, and the two should be read in conjunction.</p> <ol> <li> <p>We acknowledge that archival materials have (historically) not been described in a way that enables access to the stories of the minoritised. We are committed to centering the humanity of minoritised groups in all aspects of our work. </p> </li> <li> <p>We acknowledge that archives often describe minoritised groups with harmful and offensive language, and can bear narratives of violence and oppression inflicted on these groups. We are committed to thinking about ways people can access these archives in safer ways. </p> </li> <li> <p>We acknowledge that knowledge production is inherently influenced by power structures, with academic standards historically shaped by Global North institutions that have (in)directly benefited from the appropriation of indigenous knowledge and resources. Our core project team is based in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, in the Global North, and we therefore acknowledge that this brings inherent biases to our work. Our commitment is twofold: to actively amplify diverse perspectives in our work and to maintain transparency in our decision-making processes. We believe research must be grounded in and accountable to the communities it affects, particularly centering the voices and experiences of those most impacted. Through our global network of partners and advisors, we maintain deep connections both within our Dutch communities and internationally, enabling us to integrate a rich diversity of perspectives and lived experiences into our work.</p> </li> <li> <p>We acknowledge that working with data risks having a reductionist impact on peoples\u2019 experiences and identities. We are committed to creating human-centred descriptions and providing caring context. </p> </li> <li> <p>We acknowledge that decolonisation and reparation are unfinished endeavours, and will not be completed during this project. We are committed to working with experts and activists and remaining open-minded during and after the completion of this project to adjust to shifting narratives and needs of minoritised communities. </p> </li> <li> <p>Our research recognizes that while computational tools and AI offer valuable capabilities for analysing historical data within SSH, they can amplify existing inequities. Digital technologies often create a cycle of \u201ccoded bias\u201d<sup>1</sup> where minoritised communities face compounded discrimination through biased training data, opaque systems, labor exploitation, environmental harm, and concentrated corporate power. We address this through developing responsible data curation standards and engaging in AI policy advocacy. While we see AI\u2019s potential benefits, we maintain a critical stance - supporting beneficial applications while opposing harmful ones, recognizing that AI should serve community needs rather than be treated as inevitable.</p> </li> <li> <p>We believe in democratising access to knowledge. Our commitment to accessibility means publishing all our work through open access channels and ensuring our research outputs are freely available. </p> </li> </ol> <p>With these ethical commitments, we join a culture of previous projects committed to producing ethical and just research. We drew inspirations from these projects before us, such as, but not limited to, HIA Collection, On The Grounds, and the Rozsa Foundation. We are committed to continuously update our knowledge (and therefore, our ethical commitments) on the issues of decoloniality, fair inclusion and representation, and responsible AI use.</p> <p>Explanation of Terms</p> <ul> <li> <p>With minoritised peoples we refer to individuals or groups negatively affected by inequalities created through colonialism, exploitation, and/or discrimination. Following D\u2019Ignazio and Klein (2020)<sup>2</sup>, we prefer this term to \u2018marginalised\u2019 or \u2018minorities\u2019. \u2018Marginalised\u2019 implies a misleading binary between \u2018core\u2019 and \u2018margin\u2019, when these spaces are actually fluid and intersectional.<sup>3</sup> \u2018Minorities\u2019 defines people primarily by their oppression. In contrast, \u2018minoritisation\u2019 emphasizes the process and experience of oppression, acknowledging the humanity of those facing unjust circumstances.</p> </li> <li> <p>The term Global North, though potentially dated, refers to regions where power and wealth have historically been\u2014and continue to be\u2014concentrated. In our project\u2019s context, these are primarily regions that engaged in imperialist conquests and violent exploitation, such as Western Europe and North America. While we acknowledge the problematic dichotomy with \u2018Global South\u2019 and recognize that neither region is monolithic, we use \u2018Global North\u2019 as a practical shorthand. It helps us identify areas that gained disproportionate power and wealth through the historically unjust distribution of resources (via exploitation and extraction), in contrast to regions that suffered this violence.<sup>4</sup></p> </li> </ul> <ol> <li> <p>Ressa, Maria. 2025. \u201cOutlook: AI and Media.\u201d Presented at the International Association for Safe &amp; Ethical AI, Paris, February 6. https://www.iaseai.org/conference/program/outlook-ai-and-media.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>D\u2019ignazio, Catherine, and Lauren F.

The increasing use of data in the field of SSH has allowed for more diversity in approaches to research questions, as well as broadened the possible range of questions that can be asked.

There is harm in these biases: they can have real impacts on minoritised groups today, through the production of incorrect and/or one-dimensional narratives that further silence and obscure marginalised perspectives.

Through this, it becomes clearer how disproportionate representation or opaque documentation impacts consequent (research) conclusions and causes harm.</li> <li>Reduce harm: develop a toolkit, including a bias vocabulary and practical guidelines, to aid researchers in identifying, understanding, articulating and reducing harm caused by biases. This ultimately leads to the creation of ethical and sustainable datasets.</li> <li>Promote bias-aware research: encourage SSH researchers and practitioners to consider and reduce harmful biases during their research processes, through the active (re)consideration of certain concepts and categories used in SSH datasets (such as gender and ethnicity), as well as their own practices regarding documentation and visualisations. Additionally, strategies that highlight silences and absences in data are encouraged, such as the creation of counter-narratives, and collection or formalisation of data regarding minoritised experiences. </li> <li>Build a socially engaged network: exchange knowledge and experiences with experts from fields within the SSH and beyond.

Data is not neutral \u2013 it is always biased \u2013 and by analysing this \u2018bias\u2019, we can begin to understand the significance and impacts of our data(sources).  By scrutinising the concept of bias itself, therefore, we can use bias as a category of analysis, a lens, to address a whole host of ethical concerns when creating and using data. This attention to bias is so important because it grounds us to a method of research that is rooted in care and respect, which is precisely what is necessary when working with data, as it represents living things that require this care.</p> <p>Bias is already a widely used term in the context of creating, identifying and analysing data: it has become a real buzzword, especially in recent times with the quick development of AI tools. The EU AI Act, for example, mentions \u2018bias\u2019 25 times, but never provides an explanation of what it means exactly, nor what \u2018bias correction\u2019 should look like. Once we understand bias (in all its forms), it becomes less daunting to critically engage with it \u2013 this is why we believe it\u2019s necessary to dive into the concept of bias. </p> <p>For more on our conceptualisation of bias, see On Bias. </p>"},{"location":"about/mission/#why-datasets","title":"Why Datasets?","text":"<p>Within the broader developments of the increased entanglement between computational tools and SSH research, our framework specifically focuses on the dataset as the unit of analysis. A dataset<sup>3</sup> is where data (content of datasets, whether from archives, digitally-born or sociological interviews), researchers (creators of datasets), users (audience of datasets) and computational methods (trained on datasets) all intersect \u2013 it is therefore a necessary and productive area of intervention. </p>          Ed van der Elsken, Groningen and Kyoto students trying-out a translating computer at Kyoto University, May 1985. \u00a9 Ed van der Elsken (Rijksmuseum)      <p>Datasets are not only areas of \u2018risk\u2019 in need of intervention, they are also areas of immense possibility, if created critically and with awareness of bias. Dataset creation is the \u2018deconstruction of archival sources\u2019<sup>4</sup>, through which researchers can uncover new insights and gaps in their sources. It is, for example, due to the creation of datasets and their analysis that it becomes clear that a 17-year old woman named Flora played a key role in the escape of nineteen peoples from slavery - re-inscribing her into the historical narrative, when her name is not barely in sources. </p>"},{"location":"about/mission/#urgent-questions-and-urgent-responses","title":"Urgent Questions and Urgent Responses","text":"<p>There are several troubles with the concept of bias that make it both urgent and crucial to deal with if we want to advance within data ethics:</p> <ol> <li>As referred to previously, bias does not have a single definition, nor is it expressed or used in a uniform way. Instead, it usually refers to a host of different yet interrelated concerns, ranging from discriminatory language to opaque documentation. </li> <li>Due to its nebulousness, an expression of bias doesn\u2019t exist in isolation \u2013 biases cascade and stack on top of another. Bias from the archives is perpetuated to datasets, which in turn are used to train computational models. </li> <li>A specific issue to the SSH field is that biased data cannot simply be replaced with \u2018unbiased\u2019 alternatives. This seems to be a common strategy within the computer sciences, for example, where data is often artificially added to come to an \u2018equitable\u2019 or \u2018representative\u2019 dataset (though we would also like to question these terms\u2026). When dealing with questions about (human) experience, as is often the case in the SSH, the limited (historical) source data cannot be \u2018rewritten\u2019. Moreover, it is often these biases and their significance that is the subject of studies in the SSH, and so it would be unwanted to delete or change these datapoints.</li> </ol> <p>These three concerns are current roadblocks in the data ethics practices of the SSH and lead to the following three fundamental questions for the field: </p> <ol> <li>What do we mean by \u201cbias\u201d in (SSH) research?</li> <li>Where does bias occur in the dataset creation process? </li> <li>How do we identify, understand, articulate and reduce bias in datasets?</li> </ol>          Dayanita Singh, File Room, 2013. \u00a9 Dayanita Singh <p>We believe it is the responsibility of the dataset creators to critically reflect on the biases of the source data, and to acknowledge, contextualise and inform users about these - taking active measures to lessen the harmful impacts of biases throughout the lifecycle of data (and beyond). Combatting Bias underlines the necessity for responsible and transparent strategies to navigate these biases. Thus, addressing the above questions, the Combatting Bias project will create a framework that consists of the following corresponding components, that will help guide dataset creators and researchers produce responsible research. </p> <ul> <li>Bias Vocabulary: A comprehensive list of the concepts connected to bias (such as representation, offensive language, FAIR, CARE, silences, etc.) that creates a shared vocabulary for discussing bias across disciplines. </li> <li>Bias-Aware Data Lifecycle Model: Showing where and how bias manifests at different research stages, allowing for targeted interventions at critical points. </li> <li>Guidelines and Toolkit: Reflective questions at each stage of the dataset lifecycle, illustrative examples, and \u201cgood-better-best\u201d recommendations for bias analysis, description, and mitigation.</li> </ul> What do we mean by \"bias\" in research? Bias Vocabulary  (representation, language, opacity, etc)  Where does bias occur in the dataset creation process?  How does it compound? Bias Aware Dataset Lifecycle  (considerations around expressions of bias across lifecycle)  How do we identify, understand, and reduce bias in datasets? Guidelines and Toolkit (good-better-best, resources, considerations) <p>The above points, specifically the Vocabulary, will be integrated into existing reusable and machine-readable data documentation templates, such as the Data-Envelopes. In addition, we will create templates that encourage data awareness discussion among project teams. Through this, we not only hope to establish an ethical and sustainable framework for future data collection and curation, but also encourage that different, less represented data is collected.</p>"},{"location":"about/mission/#network-of-expertise","title":"Network of expertise","text":"<p>Combatting Bias is a collaborative project.

These are fields in which (origins of) bias has received much attention. From here, we expanded out to include sources that were not academic and/or text-based, such as videos, art installations, and fiction. The importance of including these resources was to critically confront our own biases for the written and academic. For each resource, we focused on what forms of bias or strategies to mitigate bias were present, and made a note of that under the column \u2018concepts\u2019. We compiled relevant resources in an open-to-access list of resources. </li> <li>Network Engagement: The Framework\u2019s development is guided by the insights gleaned from holding semi-structured interviews with partners from four major digital infrastructure projects focusing on colonial and slavery archives: Slave Voyages, Globalise, Exploring Slave Trade in Asia, and the Historical Database of Suriname and Caribbean. These partnerships provide crucial contributions to practical challenges and implementation requirements for a toolkit and guidelines. We also conduct conversations with our broad network of advisors, based in different parts of the world and with expertise from a range of disciplines: cultural heritage, critical archival studies, community (memory) work, natural language processing, and the FAIR principles. As a result, our framework is rooted in plurivocality (Sitzia 2023), offering a range of strategies and (precedent) examples to help researchers choose which best fits their project and available resources. </li> <li>Framework Validation and Refinement: We are validating and refining the framework through two parallel tracks: expert consultations and interactive workshops with digital humanities and social science projects. The workshops serve as practical testing grounds where participants apply the framework and its methodology to analyse bias in their own datasets. This implementation phase aims to reveal the framework\u2019s strengths and limitations across different domains and identify potential blind spots.

What\u2019s in a name","text":"<p>During our kick-off meeting, our partners and advisors asked us the question: what does it mean to \u2018combat\u2019 bias exactly? This question was posed both on a semantic level, as well as conceptual. </p> <p>The verb \u2018to combat\u2019 often has a connotation of physical \u2013 or even armed \u2013 action to it. For our project, while we do aim to take actions against (the reproduction of) harmful biases, we also want to centre acts of \u2018care\u2019 and \u2018affect\u2019 into our research.</p> <p>Additionally, \u2018combatting\u2019 bias also implies that bias can be combatted. Yet, we have to continue reflecting, analysing and engaging with bias \u2013 dealing with bias is always an unfinished business (as somebody said astutely during our workshops). There is no \u2018unbiased\u2019 alternative we can work towards. </p> <p>For these reasons, we have moved away from the implications of \u2018combatting bias\u2019, by avoiding phrases such as \u2018mitigating bias\u2019, but instead focus on raising awareness around (perpetuated) biases and reducing the harm they can cause. We have also shifted our thinking from \u2018bias\u2019 as a static concept to \u2018bias\u2019 as a productive concept \u2013 or a category of analysis. This helps conceptualise the broad concept of bias not as something to be eliminated (which is impossible!), but instead as an inherent part of your research.

The ethical data will be transparent about skewed categorisations and language the historical sources used, resulting in the prevention of the perpetuation of these (harmful) biases in the future reiterations of the data. Furthermore, it will allow current researchers to reconsider concepts in their data, reading it \u2018against the grain\u2019, and gain insight into different narratives and perspectives their historical data contains as well as which are lacking - this stimulates new research ventures. </p> <p>We, however, hope to make a broader impact than only within SSH research circles. In line with the efforts within the humanities towards decolonisation of knowledge, academia, and cultural heritage (institutions), Combatting Bias focusses these efforts on digital heritage. The project is therefore engaging in issues that may interest heritage specialists and institutions, inclusion and diversity activists, archivists among others. The general public too, as direct users of historical datasets through archives (Nationaal Archief) for example, or indirect users, such as reading articles or watching documentaries basing themselves on historical datasets, can find interest in the project. </p> <p>Can projects that are not partnered with Combatting Bias get in touch for guidance and advise about creating fair and ethical data?  Yes! We are open to feedback - especially if you have experience in the fields of fair data, digital humanities, DEI, (digital) heritage, (colonial) history. </p> <p>If you are a user of historical datasets, we would also like to hear from you!

Koen, Suyk, 1977, Amsterdam.          Image credit: Nationaal Archief <p>To begin conceptualising bias, we first turned to its etymology. \u201cBias\u201d first entered the English language in the 1570s as a technical term from the game of boules to refer to balls weighted on one side, causing them to curve obliquely. From this emerged the figurative sense of \u201ca one-sided tendency of the mind\u201d and later \u201cundue propensity or prejudice,\u201d particularly in legal contexts. The French origin biais means \u201csideways, askance, against the grain\u201d\u2014suggesting movement contrary to an expected direction.<sup>2</sup> Some etymologists trace it to Latin biaxius (\u201cwith two axes\u201d).<sup>3</sup></p> <p>This etymology prompts a critical question: when we designate something as \u201cbiased,\u201d what is the assumed \u201ctrue\u201d path?

This category is intended to distinguish theoretical resources from practical ones, aimed to be useful to researchers looking specifically for resources that can support them when engaging, explaining and/or visualising biases.</p> <p>We adhered to the following descriptions of each category, adding resources to one or multiple categories:</p> Category Description Bias  Resources that engage with the concept of \u2018bias\u2019, in all its forms, either direct or indirectly.  FAIR  Resources that use, explain, and/or build on the FAIR principles. These will focus on data - and how it is being produced, published, and stored. Dataset Creation &amp; Documentation  Resources that discuss the process of creating a dataset (including challenges and unanswered questions). Tools  Resources that are not theoretical and/or conceptual in nature, but provide concrete and practical workflows, guidelines, or templates that can help researchers engage with bias (e.g. checklists, datasheets). <p>The first resources were added based on \u2018expertise knowledge\u2019 on data ethics and search queries of \u2018bias in [discipline, e.g. LLMs, digital humanities]\u2019. From these, we snowballed into new resources, through bibliographies and references of already added resources and recommendations from colleagues, social media, events and email. </p> <p>The concepts were mostly collected through descriptive annotation (in contrast to in vivo annotation = literally cited) - assigning a relevant phrase, known to us through interviews or reading different literature (e.g. \u2018harmful language\u2019 or \u2018plurivocality\u2019) to describe the content of the resource, even if this phrase was not literally used.

Fortunately, as a historian of the Dutch East India Company (Vereenigde Oost Indische Compagnie, hereafter VOC), there is quite literally a sea of written archives that I can gleefully dive into to find pearls of information that I can string together to make the histories I write. As we might all be aware, this archive only offers a perspective of the past. The VOC entered the Indian Ocean World as a prospective trader in 1602 and established settlements and exercised varying levels of power and authority in territories of differing sizes in this maritime zone. Deploying the archives of the VOC for historical research warrants critically reflecting numerous avenues through which bias can manifest itself in the archive. It also calls on us to responsibly navigate these biases by looking within, and beyond the VOC archives. Such careful consideration of the core materials of our craft is necessary such that we can productively use these archives to write histories of both the VOC and the places, states, and people that were written about in these archives. In writing this blogpost, I do not purport to have answers or solutions for the biases that I enumerate. On the contrary, I intend to lay down a series of issues that historians of the VOC will encounter and need to inevitably ruminate about. </p>  Brush drawing of a man, possibly Brandes himself, reading on the windowsill of probably the VOC ship Stavenisse on the route Batavia - Ceylon - Cape of Good Hope.

Historians have argued that the view that this archive takes of the maritime world often manifested in the form of derogatory and patronizing characterizations of societies, religions, and cultures they encountered. Religions like Hinduism and Buddhism were presented as devilish and vile, governments were projected as despotic, and persons who opposed the ambitions of the company were projected as untrustworthy, selfish, and arrogant. Historians have learned to navigate these characterizations, as value-laden interpretations that were not representative of a reality. They have come to recognize these perspectives as revealing of the prejudices, anxieties, fears, and ambitions of the observers.<sup>1</sup>  Yet, at the same time, it is important to recognize that the archive is not all fiction and all Foucauldian discourse. While these layers of interpretation are key to studying our sources, and how contemporary observers wrote about their present, it should still be possible to peel away the layers of interpretation to reveal historical occurrences.<sup>2</sup> </p>"},{"location":"news/historicalbias/#the-presentist-bias","title":"The Presentist Bias","text":"<p>Present-day concerns invariably determine what facets of the past historians seek to study, and how they interpret the sources they analyse. Social movements in the last century such as the movement for gender equality have for instance generated interest in themes such as the history of gender and post-colonialism as a political condition in the past century generated an interest in subaltern histories, and histories of resistance.<sup>3</sup> These topical themes of the twentieth and subsequently the twenty-first centuries were almost unheard of in the period that predated this phase. We can, without a sliver of doubt, in the aforementioned trends see that interests and perspectives strongly rooted in present day culture and political movements can be vastly beneficial in initiating inquiry into and shedding light on previously understudied themes. On the other hand, anachronism or imputing present day understandings of concepts into the past can be a problem. Historians need to acknowledge the fact that the past is indeed a foreign country.<sup>4</sup> How we understand ethnicity and race in the present day starkly differs from, for instance, how these concepts were understood by the VOC. \u2018European\u2019 was not necessarily understood as a racial category, but more as a social one. No example can illustrate this argument better than the recruitment and appointment of Jan van Velsen, to the position of Dutch commander at the court, who is described in the VOC records as \u201cdark-skinned and born of a Javanese mother.\u201d<sup>5</sup> This instance forces us to take a long hard look at how we comprehend Europeanness in the context of the Dutch East India Company, who we understand as being the employees of the VOC, and the interracial unions which were very much a reality in Dutch settlements like Batavia. </p>"},{"location":"news/historicalbias/#the-embarrassment-of-riches","title":"\u201cThe Embarrassment of Riches\u201d<sup>6</sup>","text":"<p>The Dutch East India Company has left behind an obscenely voluminous archive. While on one hand, especially with regards to the English-speaking world, and those territories in maritime Asia where the VOC enjoyed a presence, it is befitting to complain about the underutilization of the archives to study histories. On the other hand, in contexts where the VOC archives have been researched and utilized, I have often wondered how this mammoth archive has influenced the historical conclusions we arrive at. Have the Dutch East India Company\u2019s penchant for record keeping, and the fact that a large part of these records have survived the exegesis of time impacted history writing? In other words, are the VOC overrepresented in histories of early modern maritime Asia? Have these archives led to historians misjudging the strength of Dutch shipping in relation to local trade? Has it led to historians overstating the presence of the VOC and in some regions, overemphasizing the colonial role and impact of the VOC? Historians of the VOC have often sought to balance out their overreliance on the VOC archive, with recourse to other European archives like the English, French, and Portuguese, and archives of other regions and empires such as Mughal, Japanese, or Javanese. More often than not, seeking recourse to alternative source material (that can also be scientific or archaeological and the like) can often be unbalanced and weighted almost entirely in favour of the VOC archives owing to its vastness. </p>"},{"location":"news/historicalbias/#downsides-of-digitization","title":"Downsides of Digitization","text":"<p>Just as we carefully consider and craft solutions for dealing with these very relevant and real issues, the digitalization of the Dutch East India Company archives has flung new challenges into the mix. While previously historians had to visit archival institutions such as the National Archives in the Hague in person and pore over archival documents for days and months on end, scanned and transcribed versions of the documents can now be perused online anywhere in the world free of change. On one hand, this accessibility radically tears down biases, in terms of who previously could and who can now access and read these archives.<sup>7</sup> On the other hand, it raises new questions as to how increased accessibility of the VOC archives can result in the overutilization of the digitized VOC archives at the expense of other local archives.

Participants highlighted that bias often stems from a lack of diversity in these processes. Even well-documented datasets can be problematic if they rely solely on Dutch or Anglophone sources, potentially missing crucial perspectives from the people central to the historical narratives. Colonial archives present additional challenges, such as westernised spellings of names and places. This not only misrepresents the original information, but also makes the data harder to find without alternative spellings. It is therefore crucial to include not only a wider range of secondary literature from different regions, but also to consult people who are language and culture experts on the region the source is describing. </p> <p>The group activity itself, with its many participants examining the data from various angles, was a case in point.

She emphasised the need for new approaches when working with a new region: there are different cultural sensitivities with regards to descendancy from enslaved persons in the Atlantic versus the Indian Ocean region for example. It\u2019s crucial to first understand what the impact of publishing new data will have on affected people\u2019s lives \u2013 travelling to these regions, engaging with their archives and heritage, and speaking to researchers are a necessary part of this.</p> <p>Similarly, presenting on Oorlog voor de Rechter, Lotte Baltussen found that much care should be taken when opening up an archive. Drawing from her experiences of mediating between different stakeholder groups and conducting user research, she has found that opening up a (historically) sensitive archive can certainly be done, if adequate contextualisation and explanations are provided. If an archive even opens up slightly without these crucial elements, the impact can be more harmful than remaining closed.</p> <p>Mandy Sanger rounded the presentation panel off by introducing her work as Head of Education at the District Six Museum. As a museum that hosts and exhibits a living archive, Mandy emphasised the importance of centering the collective human experience, through her humanising pedagogy approach.

Our ambition was to make the workshop:</p> <ol> <li>interactive, so that the expertise and energy of our collaborators could be used to the greatest extent; </li> <li>reflective and open, so everyone felt comfortable making contributions and all would be heard. </li> </ol> <p> </p> <p>  Manjusha opening the workshop  </p> <p>The interactivity came in the form of two activities to which we allocated most of the workshop time to. The first activity was \u2018Mindmapping with Magazines\u2019, where the main question was \u2018What is bias?\u2019. By looking at magazines, we created collages of images and words connected to the concept of bias. The second activity moved from conceptual thinking about bias to practical application of bias, where each group recommended good-better-best practices for dealing with different types of biases.</p> <p>In the spirit of reflexivity and openness, and inspired by Mandy\u2019s presentation the day before, we started the workshop off by positioning ourselves in the space we were in: the Bushuis, a colonial building that served as one of the main strongholds of the VOC in Amsterdam. With this historical backdrop of exploitative power and violence, the discussions from both activities interacted directly with this. Power is central to bias, acting on multiple levels: political, legal, social, and economical. </p> <p>Bias can, and is often, used normatively, for example through the passing of certain laws. Apartheid was mentioned as an example of when hegemonic biases were legalised and made normative. Moreover, economic power dictates whose emotions and perspectives are represented, as some are more economically \u2018valuable\u2019 under certain political, legal and social frameworks (where biases are made normative) than others. As research needs funding to survive, these economic frameworks continue to control what perspectives are given attention, at the expense of others. </p> <p> </p> <p>  Groups creating their bias mindmaps  </p> <p>Tying into this, ownership was also a concept that kept coming back. In line with the CARE principles, there is the necessity to transfer ownership to community groups whose data it originally is. This is a way to lessen harmful impacts of bias, as there is active involvement through ownership and management from affected communities. But for this to happen, a lack of attachment to ownership from current dominant powers is necessary. This would require a change in economic structures (i.e. funding requirements), as it\u2019s often impossible to sustain research if ownership of outputs is not secured.  </p> <p>When working on the good-better-best framework, groups struggled with finding the socially responsible \u2018bare minimum\u2019. The difficulty lay in finding a balance between feasibility (within current power structures) and utopia (where biases produce no harmful impact to community groups). Is it right that we settle for anything less than \u2018best\u2019? Yet, there are certainly actions to undertake as a \u2018good first step\u2019, mostly concerning discussions among your team and documentation \u2013 this awareness and transparency builds a way to understand the context in which decisions were made. Remaining in \u2018uncritical obliviousness\u2019, as someone put it nicely, obscures much knowledge and is not an option in good research.</p> <p>This awareness and transparency is extra important, because dealing with bias is always an unfinished business. Standards of bias change as culture and people, its longevity and intergenerational impact needs to constantly be reflected upon. It remains important and necessary to deal with harmful bias, as not dealing with it \u2018breeds mediocrity\u2019, as came up in one of our discussions. We are therefore developing guidelines \u2013 not a set of normative rules on how to deal with bias, but instead a set of reflective questions and recommendations. These can be widely used in different (humanities) projects and remain relevant over time.  </p> <p>We will be thinking further about these points and integrate them into our research moving forward.</p> <p> </p> <p>Rounding our reflection off, we\u2019d like to share some final highlights: </p> <ul> <li> <p>Diversity of participants, on three levels:</p> <ul> <li>Career stage: there were early-career researchers to professors and/or professionals with many years of experience.</li> <li>Expertise: the backgrounds and expertise of the participants ranged from community practitioners to critical archival theorists.</li> <li>Geography: where our participants were based ranged from the Netherlands to South Africa to the USA.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Success of the Combatting Bias network.

As a result, they contain many biases. Digitizing these collections and making them searchable through Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) is therefore insufficient. In developing infrastructures it is important to find ways to highlight these biases, counter them where possible and help people navigate them, to be able to explore all of the riches these archives have to offer. To celebrate the inaugural lecture of our project leader Matthias van Rossum on January 24th 2025, GLOBALISE co-organized a symposium to critically reflect on this very theme of Colonial Archives and Meaningful Digital Infrastructures. In the course of four panels that were organized, speakers from diverse fields \u2013 historians, digital humanists, artists, archivists, and representatives from the heritage sector \u2013 together with attendees on site in Nijmegen and online discussed how to undertake this task in a meaningful and ethical way, and reflected on the challenges and opportunities that come with it. </p> <p>Following the opening statements by Liedeke Plate, professor of Culture and Inclusivity and director of the Radboud Institute for Culture and History, and Matthias van Rossum, the first panel focused on the worldwide relevance of colonial archives and the potential of digitally unlocking them. </p> <p>Moderated by heritage specialist and historian Wim Manuhutu, the panellists stressed the importance of access to colonial archives for communities from former colonies and of involving them in developing infrastructures to make them accessible. Nadeera Rupesinghe, the director general of the National Archives of Sri Lanka, highlighted the vital role that colonial archives play in current issues surrounding land ownership in Sri Lanka. Creative producer and visual artist Wisaal Abrahams considered the potential of using the archives to create narratives and experiences that initiate a joint agreement about what colonialism is. Historians Margo Groenewoud and Nancy Jouwe respectively stressed the importance of involving communities in contextualizing colonial archives and treating them as equal stakeholders while doing so.</p> <p>The second panel, moderated by GLOBALISE\u2019s project manager Lodewijk Petram, focused on what follows after collections have been made searchable by generating transcriptions: how to create meaningful infrastructures? What first became clear from the panel is the value of bringing different archival collections together. Professor Hylkje de Jong, leader of the HUF project, showed how connecting court records that were created in the early modern Dutch Republic to colonial archives can lead to a better and more expansive understanding of the past. Community manager of WO2net and Onsland Thomas van Maaren showed what bringing together different archival collections looks like in practice by discussing three platforms (Oorlogsbronnen, Onsland and Oorlog voor de Rechter) thereby highlighting the importance of contextualisation and user-friendliness.

Manjusha Kuruppath, team lead at GLOBALISE, reflected on which groups will benefit from the archival accessibility facilitated by the project. Historian Luc Bulten highlighted the need for infrastructural transparency whereby users are made aware of the choices that are made in creating these infrastructures. According to Bulten, users should be told which (parts of) archival collections have been digitized and where they can find other relevant non-digitized collections. </p> <p>Historian Mark Ponte and sociologist Stephanie Welvaart focused on reaching new audiences by allowing people to add personal stories to colonial archives. Ponte talked about inviting communities to share their views and knowledge about history and to co-create presentations like exhibitions, documentaries and websites, thereby constructing new narratives. Welvaart expressed the need to create a space for emotions where people can describe and share what it means for them to read about the history they are or feel connected to, and to place these stories next to the archival material itself.</p> <p>The principal message that was echoed by various speakers in the symposium was the vital need to involve different stakeholders \u2013 from researchers to people from the former colonies \u2013 in creating meaningful digital infrastructures for unlocking colonial archives. It was reiterated that the colonial archives need to be contextualized in a way that does justice to the past and offers the means to explore its contents in accordance with today\u2019s needs. In doing so, projects and persons have to be transparent about the choices they make when creating digital infrastructures and highlight the biases that are present or still persist in the archives, and parts of the infrastructure. This ensures that users are entrusted with all the information they need to be able to use the digitized colonial archives ethically, responsibly and optimally. After all, the colonial archives hold a wide range of meanings for different people and communities. They should not only serve as a useful source for historical research but can also be a deeply personal window into the pasts of individuals and societies, revealing how colonialism shaped the past and present.</p>"},{"location":"news/positionality/","title":"\u2018I\u2019 am here! The necessity of acknowledging the historian in scholarship","text":"<p>Written by Amber Zijlma</p> <p>Positionality and bias are interconnected. In this series of blog posts, we share our thoughts on positionality by reflecting on experiences we\u2019ve had with it in our own work.</p> <p>As a history student at a British university, I was discouraged from including the personal pronoun \u2018I\u2019 in my essays. Instead, a more impersonal \u2018we\u2019, or more preferably \u2018this essay\u2019, were to be used. This seems to be the general rule of thumb for (English) academic writing, inferred from the many writing guides titled something along the lines of \u2018Using personal pronouns in writing\u2019.<sup>1</sup> University writing guides agree that the \u2018I\u2019 is recommended only when the assignment is reflexive or when a personal experience is explicitly relevant to the piece of writing. </p> <p>While it is very valid that the \u2018I\u2019 sometimes just makes sentences more complicated and less easy to read, I think much of the reasoning for avoiding this personal pronoun is to present some form of objectivity to a paper. Objectivity is then associated with authority, believability, and legitimacy within academia. Some writing guides touch on this point that the \u2018I\u2019 highlights the author\u2019s position within the research - and that this is not always wanted or necessary. </p> <p>My point here is, however, that the author\u2019s position - the \u2018I\u2019 - is always relevant.<sup>2</sup> Subjectivity is inherent to writing, researching, and just existing, really. Not being able to acknowledge an author\u2019s positionality, their identity and context and narrative, means feigning objectivity (an \u2018unbiased\u2019 history) that doesn\u2019t exist. And this is a much bigger issue that goes beyond whether or not the use of \u2018I\u2019 is \u2018good academic practice\u2019.   </p> <p>I find it quite ironic, because historians are acutely aware of the significance of positionality. We spend much of our research time on critically analysing the significance of the author\u2019s background of (primary) sources, so to understand in what way we should read the source itself. Expressing our own identities, however, is heavily discouraged, whether it is through the use of \u2018I\u2019 or personal anecdotes in our writing. </p> <p>Admittedly, I too believed for a long time that my writing had to be as impersonal as I could make it. That was until I was writing up a blog post for an internship I was doing, and my internship supervisor prompted me to specifically include why I chose to write about the topic I had researched. The project<sup>3</sup> I was a part of conducted research into World War II photographs of Jewish people in the Netherlands, and I had come across a photograph taken in my hometown, Apeldoorn. It was taken in an area I had passed many times, without ever being aware of the history behind it - I felt ashamed for my unknowing, and this drove me to write something about this history. Acknowledging my presence in the narrative, made the writing more immediate, urgent, and transparent.<sup>4</sup> </p> <p>This adds to what my internship supervisor told me: that much of the history writing on resistances is grounded in activism, writers overtly merging their identities as historians and activists, often not out of sole interest but necessity.<sup>5</sup> There is therefore power in this self-reflection in research: not only does it show self-awareness to the reader; it can also strengthen the research, because the author\u2019s identity adds their lived experiences to their writing, providing depth and perspective. </p> <p>This is especially important, because history itself is a collection of multiple perspectives and interpretations of the past, sometimes contradictory, that exist alongside each other.<sup>6</sup> The reluctance to present a historical narrative in a way that acknowledges the human nature of its writing, is therefore damaging to knowledge production, as it contradicts the essence of history itself: a plurivocal narrative of the past. And so, these perspectives need to be clearly laid out to be able to facilitate transparent discussions about history. </p> <p>I think including the \u2018I\u2019 is one way to openly acknowledge biases that are present in an author\u2019s positionality. There is power in this recognition, as well as value in enabling transparent discussion. History writing, after all, is inherently subjective, and consequently, history itself consists of (opposing) narratives and experiences. Understanding the human nature of this is crucial - only then can we properly reflect on biases present in historical research and navigate them effectively.</p> <p> </p> <p>  Figures 1 and 2: I am here!

Our goal was not to dictate narratives but to present raw data in compelling visualizations, allowing visitors to discover stories and form their own interpretations.

These datasets exist because the VOC meticulously documented aspects of its operations aligned with its bureaucratic and commercial priorities, and these documents were subsequently preserved in the archives. For example, the VOC Opvarenden dataset reflects the payroll system, including only European crew, while ignoring the many Asian workers crucial to the VOC\u2019s operations. Similarly, the BGB dataset omits private trade by VOC personnel (which was permitted to some extent), VOC trade bypassing Batavia, and, crucially, trade conducted by Asian merchants on the same routes. These gaps highlight how the VOC\u2019s perspective\u2014rooted in its administrative priorities\u2014frames what is visible in the data and what remains obscured.

For instance, one of the topics we explored in an experience was women in the service of the VOC.

While I had thought about how these situations might have been handled, I hadn\u2019t deeply questioned the nature of these records. Dyonna Benett, however, did.

They are being \u2018very very upfront about what are the biases that you are encountering\u2019, which is more than most institutions manage.</p> <p>My interviews with archivists, curators, and researchers highlighted other technical solutions that can provide safer access: navigational aids for non-expert users, trigger warnings, multiple entry points, emotional check-in prompts, tutorials, and simple guides explaining how to use translation tools with historical documents. </p> <p>These improvements matter. They represent genuine attempts to make colonial archives less harmful and more useful. But technical solutions, however thoughtful, can only go so far when the fundamental problem is structural. Better search engines don\u2019t change whose voices are in the archive. Bias warnings don\u2019t restore missing perspectives. We cannot simply digitise our way out of colonialism.</p>"},{"location":"news/when-archives-break-hearts/#beyond-technical-fixes","title":"Beyond Technical Fixes","text":"<p>This became clear through my conversations with people doing this work. The design student channeled her archival breakdown into performance art, creating a character based on La Llorona \u2013 the weeping woman of Latin American folklore \u2013 and walking through the same archives that had traumatised her.</p> <p>\u2018My project in the archive is about bringing people to cry\u2019, she told me, \u2018because we haven\u2019t made the proper mourning of this era. And we just keep going as if it was nothing but there is a lot of pain behind them. Still, we can feel it these days.\u2019</p> Becoming La Llorona: Healing the Colonial Wound through Crying, 2024.     Performance by Juliana Acero Castellanos (Non-linear Narrative, Royal Academy of Art, The Hague). Presented at Archival Frictions, The Hague. Photo: Matteo Montalvo.  <p>Another insight came from a curator who worked on projects where communities were not just consulted but given genuine authority over their own narratives. She described how \u2018for the communities, it was very important to have their narratives told in a certain way [\u2026] when it was about colonialism, there always was the view that things like resistance should take the lead. And it should not be a story about victimhood.\u2019</p> <p>This crystallized something crucial: reinterpretation and filling in the missing voices can be a form of healing. Communities need spaces where they can grieve, rage, reclaim, and ultimately transform their relationship with these materials.</p>"},{"location":"news/when-archives-break-hearts/#the-work-ahead-and-why-its-hard","title":"The Work Ahead and Why It\u2019s Hard","text":"<p>My conversations revealed what true transformation could look like, but also why it remains challenging. It would mean communities controlling how their materials are digitised, described, and shared. It would mean archives structured around community needs rather than academic convenience alone. It would mean funding models that support relationship-building rather than just project completion.</p> <p>As one researcher told me, decolonisation isn\u2019t a theory \u2013 \u2018it is something that we need to live right? It\u2019s the practice of critically thinking about what Europe has told us\u2019 while working to \u2018empower basically those who have been silenced by the dynamics of the colonial power [\u2026] in a collaborative, equally horizontal, way of thinking.\u2019 This is not about making existing systems more inclusive; it\u2019s about transferring power. And that\u2019s precisely why it\u2019s so hard.</p> <p>But here is what I learned: our institutions are not structured for this kind of work. Community partnerships often emerge from scheduling needs rather than genuine commitment. As one curator candidly described: \u2018They invited us to make an exhibition and umm yeah, they had a gap in their programming and then they thought, okay, let\u2019s fill the gap, and ask communities to make an exhibition with us or for us.\u2019</p> <p>The most successful partnerships I heard about involved years of relationship-building, not months. Yet funding cycles reward innovation over sustainability, leaving promising partnerships to wither when grants end. This treats community voices as content to fill institutional spaces rather than authorities with decision-making power over their own histories.</p>"},{"location":"news/when-archives-break-hearts/#the-hardest-questions","title":"The Hardest Questions","text":"<p>The hardest questions are not technical; they are about power. Who gets to control these materials? </p> <p>Many archival materials are not simply historical artifacts \u2013 they are still alive and important today. In Latin American indigenous communities, traditional maps are not simply territorial records but active participants in rain ceremonies, carried up mountains during rituals. \u2018They are living documents because they do not only speak about the rights of land\u2019, a researcher explained, \u2018but they might take these documents to petition for rain.\u2019</p> <p>When institutions digitise such materials without community input, they are making unilateral decisions about living cultural heritage that isn\u2019t theirs. Many communities only discover their sacred objects in foreign archives when digitisation makes them visible online. \u2018When you actually talk with the communities\u2019, one researcher observed, \u2018they actually care very much about them [\u2026] in the moment that they realise that they are somewhere else, why would you not want to have documents of your great grandparents?\u2019</p> <p>True governance would mean communities control materials that were, as one researcher noted, \u2018extracted violently.\u2019 They should decide if their cultural materials get digitised at all, how they are described and contextualised, and who gets to see them. Until communities have this power, digitisation will keep repeating the same colonial story \u2013 taking without asking, deciding without consulting, extracting without returning.</p>"},{"location":"news/when-archives-break-hearts/#what-it-will-take","title":"What It Will Take","text":"<p>The question is not whether we can build better colonial archives. It is whether we can build something entirely different: participatory spaces where historical trauma transforms into collective healing, where silenced voices claim interpretive authority, and where breaking hearts find the support they need to mend.</p> <p>This requires institutional courage. The technology exists. The communities are ready. What\u2019s missing is the willingness to restructure funding models, evaluation metrics, and decision-making processes to genuinely share control over stories that were never ours alone to tell.</p> <p>Sometimes the most important changes begin with someone crying in a reading room, refusing to accept that this is just how things are. Sometimes they begin with a digital post-it note stuck to a centuries-old document, saying: \u2018This is not how we remember it.\u2019</p> <p>The archives will keep breaking hearts until we stop asking how to make colonial collections more accessible and start doing the work to make knowledge systems more just. Some problems can be solved with better technology. Others require us to question who gets to control the past \u2013 and act on those answers. </p>"}]}
