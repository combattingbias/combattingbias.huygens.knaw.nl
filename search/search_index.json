The increasing use of data in the field of SSH has allowed for more diversity in approaches to research questions, as well as broaden the possible range of questions that can be asked. However, historical data used in SSH research is by nature overwhelmed by biases, impacted by the author\u2019s positionality and context, producing problematic language and categorisations. The complexity of this issue in the field of SSH lies within the fact that these skewed perspectives cannot simply be replaced with less biased alternatives (a \u2018rewriting\u2019 of the archives). Instead, we believe it is the responsibility of the dataset creators to critically reflect on the biases of the source data, and to acknowledge, contextualise and inform users about these. Combatting Bias underlines the necessity for responsible and transparent strategies to navigate these biases. Thus, we aim to create lasting and flexible handholds for dataset creators to guide them in this process. </p> <p>We will therefore produce a set of guidelines for data creation that we call FAIR+. These guidelines will be rooted in the existing FAIR principles, aimed at developing a technically sustainable data creation process; combined with crucial ethical considerations enmeshed in the field of SSH, which have become more pronounced as the field increasingly uses digital infrastructures to support and enable research. This encourages the creation of documentation and datasheets that critically and transparently reflect on our data and data curation practices. In line with the FAIR+ guidelines, we will additionally create reusable templates that can be used for ethical data documentation. Through this, we not only hope to establish an ethical and sustainable framework for future data collection and curation, but also encourage that different, less represented data is collected. </p>"},{"location":"About/Mission/#network-of-expertise","title":"Network of expertise","text":"<p>Combatting Bias is a collaborative project.

The project is primarily aimed at dataset creators working in the field of SSH, practically providing guidance in the process of creating ethical historical data. The ethical data will be transparent about skewed categorisations and language the historical sources used, resulting in the prevention of the perpetuation of these (harmful) biases in the future reiterations of the data. Furthermore, it will allow current researchers to reconsider concepts in their data, reading it \u2018against the grain\u2019, and gain insight into different narratives and perspectives their historical data contains as well as which are lacking - this stimulates new research ventures. </p> <p>We, however, hope to make a broader impact than only within SSH research circles. In line with the efforts within the humanities towards decolonisation of knowledge, academia, and cultural heritage (institutions), Combatting Bias focusses these efforts on digital heritage. The project is therefore engaging in issues that may interest heritage specialists and institutions, inclusion and diversity activists, archivists among others. The general public too, as direct users of historical datasets through archives (Nationaal Archief) for example, or indirect users, such as reading articles or watching documentaries basing themselves on historical datasets, can find interest in the project. </p> <p>Can projects that are not partnered with Combatting Bias get in touch for guidance and advise about creating fair and ethical data?  Yes! We are open to feedback - especially if you have experience in the fields of fair data, digital humanities, DEI, (digital) heritage, (colonial) history. </p> <p>If you are a user of historical datasets, we would also like to hear from you! Datasets are ultimately used by people - hence, while focusing on the ethical integrity of historical datasets, it is also important to us that the datasets and their attached documentation are easy to use. We are interested in what is important and/or challenging to different groups of users when engaging with data. </p> <p>Find out how to contact us here.</p> <p>How long will the project run for?

The event brought together our wide network of partners and advisors, both in-person and online. </p> <p>The day began with project introductions and research presentations, highlighting our shared ambition to create FAIR and ethical datasets for the humanities. The diversity of approaches and expertise within our network was immediately apparent, setting the stage for rich discussions.

Can it be combatted?</li> </ol> <p>The breakout sessions were eye-opening and raised some crucial points on creating ethical and sustainable datasets: </p>"},{"location":"News/Kickoff/#1-balancing-openness-and-sensitivity","title":"1. Balancing Openness and Sensitivity","text":"<p>First, we all agreed that datasets should adhere to the FAIR principles. This makes the data easy to search and use for both humans and computers. However, we also realised that this isn\u2019t always straightforward, especially when dealing with sensitive personal information from colonial sources. This thus left us with the question: should data be open and accessible, even when it may perpetuate harmful stereotypes and/or disclose personal information?</p>"},{"location":"News/Kickoff/#2-effective-documentation","title":"2. Effective Documentation","text":"<p>Another key topic was the importance of good documentation. We agreed that thorough records are crucial for transparency and usability. Ideally, documentation should cover various aspects, including but not limited to: the aim of the dataset, definitions of variables and historical terms, content and context of sources, decision-making processes that influenced dataset creation, and its potential biases.</p> <p>However, we face the challenge of balancing thoroughness with accessibility. While we aim for transparency, overly extensive documentation can be overwhelming. Most users won\u2019t read through pages of information. Our challenge lies in deciding what information is most important to highlight and how to present it effectively for various users.</p>"},{"location":"News/Kickoff/#3-diverse-perspectives-are-essential","title":"3. Diverse Perspectives are Essential","text":"<p>Lastly, we talked about the need to include diverse perspectives in our work. Participants highlighted that bias often stems from a lack of diversity in these processes. Even well-documented datasets can be problematic if they rely solely on Dutch or Anglophone sources, potentially missing crucial perspectives from the people central to the historical narratives. Colonial archives present additional challenges, such as westernised spellings of names and places. This not only misrepresents the original information, but also makes the data harder to find without alternative spellings. It is therefore crucial to include not only a wider range of secondary literature from different regions, but also to consult people who are language and culture experts on the region the source is describing. </p> <p>The group activity itself, with its many participants examining the data from various angles, was a case in point. It highlighted how diverse perspectives can reveal different kinds of biases.</p> Teams deep in dataset analysis <p>The afternoon was a very encouraging start to the project.
