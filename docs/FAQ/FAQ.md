**Who should be interested in the work of the project?** <br>
The project is primarily aimed at dataset creators working in the field of SSH, practically providing guidance in the process of creating ethical historical data. The ethical data will be transparent about skewed categorisations and language the historical sources used, resulting in the prevention of the perpetuation of these (harmful) biases in the future reiterations of the data. Furthermore, it will allow current researchers to reconsider concepts in their data, reading it ‘against the grain’, and gain insight into different narratives and perspectives their historical data contains as well as which are lacking - this stimulates new research ventures. 

We, however, hope to make a broader impact than only within SSH research circles. In line with the efforts within the humanities towards decolonisation of knowledge, academia, and cultural heritage (institutions), Combatting Bias focusses these efforts on digital heritage. The project is therefore engaging in issues that may interest heritage specialists and institutions, inclusion and diversity activists, archivists among others. The general public too, as direct users of historical datasets through archives (Nationaal Archief) for example, or indirect users, such as reading articles or watching documentaries basing themselves on historical datasets, can find interest in the project.

**Can projects that are not partnered with Combatting Bias get in touch for guidance and advise about creating fair and ethical data?** <br>
Yes! We are open to feedback - especially if you have experience in the fields of fair data, digital humanities, DEI, (digital) heritage, (colonial) history. 

If you are a user of historical datasets, we would also like to hear from you! Datasets are ultimately used by people - hence, while focusing on the ethical integrity of historical datasets, it is also important to us that the datasets and their attached documentation are easy to use. We are interested in what is important and/or challenging to different groups of users when engaging with data.
