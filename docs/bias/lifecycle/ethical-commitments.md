## When undertaking this task, what should you consider?

[**Positionality**](bias/types/positionality)

- How does the social, political, economic, cultural, academic context you are embedded in relate to advancing social justice? 
    - Are you conducting research from a position of historical privilege? (For example, are you based in a former colonial power studying colonized regions?) How can you then use the benefits of your context to advance the deconstruction of existing power structures?

[**Transparency**](bias/types/transparency)

- Do you have any ethical concerns about the research? Think of: 
    - What accessibility barriers might your research create or reinforce?
    - How might your research methodologies perpetuate existing inequalities?

## What are good practices in relation to this task?

- Use the format: _We acknowledge [injustice]. We are committed to [action to lessen the burden of injustice]._ This provides a succinct overview for readers to know what you stand for and how your actions will reflect this.[^1]

- Include your gut-feelings about the project, including concerns.[^2]

- Add positionality statements to your Ethical Commitments, clearly communicating to your audience your awareness of the context you work in and what you benefit from.[^3]

- Include versioning into your Ethical Commitments to encourage regular re-evaluation during the project.
