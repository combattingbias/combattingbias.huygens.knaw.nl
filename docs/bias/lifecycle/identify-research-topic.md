## When undertaking this task, what should you consider?

[**Positionality**](bias/types/positionality)

- How does the social, political, economic, cultural, academic context you are embedded in impact your choice of research?
- Are there policies/guidelines within your institution that are relevant to your project - if so, which ones?[^1]

[**Silences**](bias/types/silences)

- What gaps exist in current research? 
- What gaps are you trying to fill in your research? Time period, geography, actors, concepts?
- What is your primary source data and what are its advantages and shortcomings? 

[**Representation**](bias/types/representation)

- Who is represented in the scholarship and sources that are used? And who is not represented? 


[**Impact**](bias/types/impact)

- Who do the scholarship and/or research projects currently impact positively and/or negatively, and in what way? In terms of accessibility (digital divide), representation, use of language?

## What are good practices in relation to this task?

- Reflect on these questions as part of project conceptualization.
- Document discussions held, research done and decisions made for future reference. 
- Have your research be led by social justice values and positive societal impact - however your project may define these.[^2]
- Ensure your research question(s) are shaped by the availability and content of sources. Heavily biased sources can be the best resources for one research question, but totally unfit to answer another.
