## When undertaking this task, what should you consider?

[**Positionality**](bias/types/positionality)

- How does the social, political, economic, cultural, academic context you are embedded in impact what topics of research are receiving funding? In what way are you aligning your research to this?
- Does your institution have in-house expertise on writing successful funding proposals? How does this impact your position?


[**Recruitment**](bias/types/recruitment)

- Will your recruitment practices be inclusive?

[**Collaboration**](bias/types/collaboration)

- In what way could you work with affected communities? 
- In what way could you collaborate with specialist academics/researchers to mitigate potential biases in your research? 

[**Representation**](bias/types/representation)

- Who is and who is not represented in your research funding outline? 

[**Impact**](bias/types/impact)

- Who would your research impact positively and/or negatively, and in what way? In terms of agenda, accessibility (digital divide), representation, use of language? 

## What are good practices in relation to this task?

- Include ethical considerations into your proposal, whether or not this is asked for. Show the funding agency that alongside their own mission, ethical considerations are necessary and urgent to think about. 

- Speak about how will you allocate money to the combatting of bias (e.g. extra personnel, part of research is on ethics issues, pot of money for collaboration, widen theme of research or source base as an attempt to combat bias)

- Actively pursue the allocation of money to collaborate with affected communities. Ensure enough money is set aside for all aspects of community engagement (monetary remuneration for expertise; cultivating sense of community between collaborators/citizen scientists[^1]). Also consider whether you can create sustainable networks that will contribute to the setting up of future projects. 

- Focus on the creation of a diverse and inclusive project and team.
