## Description
_During **Set up**, the research is conceptualised, planned and funded. This stage highlights the environment in which dataset creation will happen, as the research question, mission and values will be defined and data collection practices outlined. At this stage, you are thinking about dataset creation as a potential method and/or output for your research, but are not actively undertaking creation yet - this stage merely sets the scene for it._
