**Description**: A mission statement articulates your project's purpose, values, and approach. It serves as both an internal compass and a public declaration of your research intentions, ethical stance, and expected outcomes.

## When undertaking this task, what should you consider?

[**Transparency**](/bias/types/transparency)

- How active will your intervention be?
- Who will your research impact positively/negatively?
- What is the proposed outcome of the research? Could there be unintended uses and/or consequences?
- What values drive your work and how are they reflected in your work? 
- Are there any accessibility restrictions?

## What are good practices in relation to this task?

- Reflect on all questions above and incorporate answers, ideas and concerns into your mission statement. This will ensure **expectation management** for collaborators and audiences. 

- Outline values/research philosophy that drive your research
    - For example: Community, Trust and Time, Knowledge (Co-)Production, Redistribution, Accountability, Interrogating Power, Imagination.[^1]

- Discuss how active your ethical intervention will be.
    - For example: <br>
    Contentious language will not be included as preflabels in published datasets, but will feature in public user interface (_Globalise_). <br>
    Contentious language will feature in public user interface, but with a caveat box providing context (_Slave Voyages_).<br>
    Contentious language will be retained for the historicity of sources, but alternative terms will be used to write about the sources (_Historical Database of Suriname and Caribbean_). 

- Include any parts of your research that should be contextualised up front: use of contentious categories, naming, terms, and/or keywords; errors that may be found; choices for use of specific language over others.[^2]

- Outline predicted outputs. 

- Outline imagined use of your research (data). 
    - Also include imagines accessibility restrictions (e.g. data can only be accessed onsite, or with an account). 
    - Also include restrictions, in terms of licensing.[^3]

- Include ways for audiences (both academic and broader) to contact, engage with and/or provide feedback to the project. 

- Include versioning into your Mission Statement to encourage regular re-evaluation during the project.

- Acknowledge that responsible research will always evolve, and is therefore never-ending (even after project end). Manage expectations regarding this in your mission statement.
