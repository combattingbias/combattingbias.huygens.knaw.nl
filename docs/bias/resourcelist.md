This [**List of Resources**](https://www.zotero.org/groups/5670390/combatting_bias/library)[^1], as it is in its current form (August 2025), is the result of our initial enquiries into works, scholarship and practices around broad topics central to the Combatting Bias project: Bias, Dataset Creation and Documentation and the FAIR Principles.

> **Our aim**: A bottom-up overview of concerns surrounding bias and related topics, as well as an insight into the scatteredness of these relevant resources. Collecting these resources into an accessible and shareable list ‚Äî ideally editable as well, so it can reflect current interests and needs of those working with/on bias and so become community-driven. Furthermore, as knowledge does not merely exist in the realm of (peer-reviewed) academic papers and/or publications, we did our best to include films, exhibitions, fiction, and more. In this way we wanted this list to reflect a wide range of perspectives and approaches. 

> **The outcome**: An accessible List of Resources that reflects our initial research process. We were not able to find a good way to make the list openly editable, but we are grateful to those who reached out to us to recommend resources to add. Through this exercise, we‚Äôve found that ‚Äòbias‚Äô can represent many interconnected themes and is often used as a [**heuristic**](/bias/onbias/bias-as-heuristic). 

This list, together with the interviews with our network, forms the theoretical basis of the Bias-Aware Framework, as well as provides concepts to include in the [**Bias Vocabulary**](bias/biasvocabulary). It also includes practical tools included in the Bias-Aware Guidelines. 

We‚Äôre grateful to anyone who has contributed to this list, either directly or indirectly ‚Äî these resources are truly the result of a collaborative effort. We hope that this list can be of use to those navigating and grappling with this concept of bias.

_The resource list is available as **(Excel) spreadsheet** or **Zotero library**. Please note that there may be slight differences between the two as they have been created side-by-side (and not updated simultaneously)._

## The Challenge of ‚ÄúSorting Things Out‚Äù

Each resource has a category(-ies), field(s), and concept(s) assigned to it. 

---

**Categories**: The ‚Äòcategories‚Äô are one of four broad themes, presented as subfolders (Bias, Dataset Creation and Documentation, FAIR, and Tools). 

---

**Fields**: This refers to the (academic) field the resource is situated in. These, too, are broad categories and are also not mutually exclusive from one another. In the Zotero list, they are presented as tags with capitals.

From how overwhelming this list of concepts is, it is clear that the concept-tags do not necessarily categorise the resources in a workable way. The goal was also not to achieve a formal framework for categorisation for these resources; instead, it meant to show the whole range of concepts that can be associated with ‚Äòbias‚Äô (also through FAIR and documentation). 

This range of concepts shows that bias is a [**‚Äòheuristic‚Äô**](/bias/onbias/bias-as-heuristic), which can be a productive [**category of analysis**](/bias/onbias/) in research processes. Please note that not all concepts outlined above are incorporated into the Bias Vocabulary, as this list represents our initial orientation for our research.

## Methodology

We did not have a systematic methodology for the compilation of resources. The selection-criteria for including resources to the list was their relevance to one of the (initially) three categories: Bias, FAIR and Dataset Creation & Documentation. This relevance could either be direct (e.g. a philosophical paper outlining different ‚Äòvarieties of bias‚Äô: [Johnson, 2024](https://doi.org/10.1111/phc3.13011)) or indirect (e.g. an artist‚Äôs video aiming to traverse the gap existing in the archives on the lived experiences of children sent from the Danish West Indies to Denmark and displayed at the colonial exhibition: [La Vaughn Belle, 2022](https://www.lavaughnbelle.com/home-1#/in-the-place-of-shadows/)). 

The category for ‚ÄòTools‚Äô was added while we matched the list from the Google Sheets to the current Zotero list. This category is intended to distinguish theoretical resources from practical ones, aimed to be useful to researchers looking specifically for resources that can support them when engaging, explaining and/or visualising biases.

We adhered to the following descriptions of each category, adding resources to one or multiple categories:

<table>
<tr>
<td><b>Category</b></td> <td><b>Description</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> <b>Bias</b></td> <td> Resources that engage with the concept of ‚Äòbias‚Äô, in all its forms, either direct or indirectly. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> <b>FAIR</b> </td> <td> Resources that use, explain, and/or build on the FAIR principles. These will focus on data - and how it is being produced, published, and stored.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> <b>Dataset Creation & Documentation</b> </td> <td> Resources that discuss the process of creating a dataset (including challenges and unanswered questions).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> <b>Tools</b> </td> <td> Resources that are not theoretical and/or conceptual in nature, but provide concrete and practical workflows, guidelines, or templates that can help researchers engage with bias (e.g. checklists, datasheets).</td>
</tr>
</table>

The first resources were added based on ‚Äòexpertise knowledge‚Äô on data ethics and search queries of ‚Äòbias in [discipline, e.g. LLMs, digital humanities]‚Äô. From these, we **snowballed** into new resources, through bibliographies and references of already added resources and recommendations from colleagues, social media, events and email. 

The concepts were mostly collected through **descriptive annotation** (in contrast to _in vivo_ annotation = literally cited) - assigning a relevant phrase, known to us through interviews or reading different literature (e.g. ‚Äòharmful language‚Äô or ‚Äòplurivocality‚Äô) to describe the content of the resource, even if this phrase was not literally used. This was so to balance bottom-up research with at least some form of systematic consistency.

Because of the lack of systematic methodology for collating materials, the list we created is far from comprehensive. Our interests and networks are represented in the list. Our choice to make it public was therefore based on this awareness, inviting more perspectives to engage with these topics and to add to our resources. The list in its current form is a transparent insight into the development of our thinking and basis of the Bias-Aware Framework. **Please do not use or interpret this list as a comprehensive overview.**
