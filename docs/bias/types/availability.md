## Definition
Denotes whether a source of data is in existence, reachable and operational. 

_Definition source: **Combatting Bias definition** (based on technical definitions for ‘data availability’)_.

## Stakes
_part of: **discrimination**_

_related to: **accessibility**_

Availability of sources impacts what type of research you can conduct and conclusions you can draw. Acknowledging a lack of availability signals to the audience that narratives are likely missing from the output. Availability also creates accountability.

## Where does it occur in the lifecycle?

**2 - Collection**

- [Select and curate sources and/or data](/bias/lifecycle/collection)

## Questions to consider throughout your work
- What sources are available (e.g. only written sources, no oral sources; only governmental reports, no personal histories)? 
- In what way does a lack of availability of sources skew your dataset (e.g. do you only have data on certain communities and not others)?


## Examples
- The Public Source (2024). Against Genocide: Mapping the Future of Palestine, One Archive at a Time. https://thepublicsource.org/archiving-against-genocide-palestine
- The Accountability Archive: https://accountabilityarchive.org/

## Good-better-best practices

| Good | Better | Best|
|---|---|---|
|If there are gaps in source availability, document and make this information known to users.| If you recognize gaps in the sources used, and are aware of ways in which these sources can be incorporated in your research but are unable to do so due to financial or other constraints, make this known in your dataset documentation. | Proactively seek out sources that can provide you with alternative perspectives and make your research multivocal. Write these sources into our research plan and budget for accessing and working with these sources. 
| | If the impact of the non-inclusion of certain sources can have significant implications on how your dataset is comprehended and used, consider ways in which this information can also be included in the dataset, written publications and other output that build on the dataset. | |
