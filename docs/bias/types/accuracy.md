## Definition
Being exact or correct.

_Definition source: **Cambridge Dictionary (n.d.).** accuracy. https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/accuracy_

## Stakes
_part of: **opacity**_

It is important to be as accurate as you can be - describing precisely your process or avoiding factual mistakes in descriptions or annotations for example. Inaccurate information left in your data, will be transposed onto subsequent research using your data. 

## Where does it occur in the lifecycle?

**2 - Collection**

- [Create metadata for the data](/bias/lifecycle/collection)

**3 - Process**

- [Annotate your data](/bias/lifecycle/process)

## Questions to consider throughout your work
- Is your metadata correct? 
- Is the metadata of your source (data) correct?
- How accurate are your annotations? 

## Examples
- The NIOD [Behind the Star](https://www.niodimagelab.nl/behind-the-star) project found captions of images in the [Beeldbank WO2](https://beeldbankwo2.nl/nl/achter-de-ster) were incorrect: they ascribed the wrong date to events and/or wrong locations to where the pictured were made. The captions and metadata have since been updated.

## Good-better-best practices

| Good | Better | Best|
|---|---|---|
|Double-check whether you havenâ€™t made any factual and/or spelling errors in your data, categories or documentation.| Ensure the metadata of your sources does not include incorrect information. If this is the case, make note of this in your documentation.| Correct factually incorrect metadata of your sources. Make note of this change in your documentation, as well as keeping the old metadata stored somewhere.|
