## Good-better-best practices

| Good | Better | Best|
|---|---|---|
|Double-check whether you havenâ€™t made any factual and/or spelling errors in your data, categories or documentation.| Ensure the metadata of your sources does not include incorrect information. If this is the case, make note of this in your documentation.| Correct factually incorrect metadata of your sources. Make note of this change in your documentation, as well as keeping the old metadata stored somewhere.|
