## Definition
"A central tenet of science: To produce a reliable scientific body of knowledge, researchers must be able to trace the steps of each other’s work and verify that they yield the claimed results, or to explore why they don’t."
 
_Definition source: **Reproducibility Network (n.d.). [About](https://reproducibilitynetwork.nl/about-nlrn/){:target="_blank"}.**_

## Stakes
_part of: **opacity**_

_related to: **documentation**; **FAIR**; **accessibility**; **provenance**_

If research is not reproducible, it means the process has been untransparent. The research, as a result, is not trustworthy and lacks accountability.

## Where does it occur in the lifecycle?

**4 - Analyse**

- [Analysing and Interpreting Data](/lifecycle/analyse/#analysing-and-interpreting-data)

**5 - Preserve & Share**

- [Create or choose an interface to publish data, analyses, visualisations and other publications](/lifecycle/preserve-share/#create-or-choose-an-interface-to-publish-data-analyses-visualisations-and-other-publications)

## Questions to consider throughout your work

- Have you documented your analysis process sufficiently for others to reproduce it?
- How are you handling intersectionality in your analysis?
- Do your interpretations risk essentializing complex identities?

## Good-better-best practices

| Good | Better | Best|
|---|---|---|
| Make your research data freely available.| Make data documentation available and downloadable | Keep detailed and openly accessible documentation of decisions made and actions taken.| 
| | | Adhere to the FAIR Principles.|
