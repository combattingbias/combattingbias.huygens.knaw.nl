## Definition
Maintenance of data's integrity and availability for the future. Done in a sustainable way, it minimises environmental impact.

_Definition source: **Sustainability Directory (2025). [Data Durability](https://energy.sustainability-directory.com/term/data-durability/){:target="_blank"}.**_

## Stakes
_part of: **opacity**, **discrimination**_

_related to: **FAIR**_

Enabling accessibility and availability of your research output after the end of your project, is very valuable, because it allows other researchers to build off of your work.  

## Where does it occur in the lifecycle?

**1 - Set up**

- [Write Data Management Plan (DMP)](/lifecycle/setup/#write-a-data-management-plan-dmp)

## Questions to consider throughout your work
- How will you ensure your data remains FAIR in the future, after the project ends?

## Examples
- DANS Easy: https://easy.dans.knaw.nl/easy-static/index.html
    - Sustainable data archiving repository.

## Good-better-best practices

| Good | Better | Best|
|---|---|---|
|Formally publish your documentation and data to an (external) repository.| Ensure that someone (e.g. a data management department) inherits your raw data from you and regularly checks it. | Choose the repository you want your dataset to feature in based on the durability and continued management of the repository.|
| | | Maintain dataset versioning and ensure that the documentation plots the different changes made in the different versions of data and metadata. |
