## Good-better-best practices

| Good | Better | Best|
|---|---|---|
|Present offensive terms taken directly from the archive in quotation marks. | Explaining that words were or were not maintained from (primary) sources and/or other datasets, and explaining why this decision was made.[^1]| “For collections or discovery portals where users may be harmed by encountering offensive language, it may be appropriate to replace offensive language in primary user-facing description. For an example of this approach, refer to the language policy for the Find & Connect website on child welfare in Australia.”[^2]|
| Contextualise potentially harmful descriptions and words. | Acknowledge the evolving nature of terminology guidelines.| During annotation, use alt- and pref-labels to curate how your dataset will be viewed and read. |
| Reference community-approved guidelines. See resources below. | Create research guides with relevant search terms for users on offensive language in historical records.| Create standardized institutional language that can be reused. See resources below. | 
| | | Implement participatory methods for tagging and description. Consult communities and experts on terminology. See [Collaboration](/bias/types/collaboration).|
