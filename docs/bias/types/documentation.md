## Definition
The descriptive account of the process of creating or curating information. This record accompanies the publication of such information. It provides contextualising information from a disciplinary point of view.

## Stakes
_part of: **opacity**_
_related to: **transparency**_

Creating extensive documentation is crucial to ensure adequate contextualisation of your research and transparency around research practices. This creates accountability as well. 

## Where does it occur in the lifecycle?

## Good-better-best practices

| Good | Better | Best|
|---|---|---|
| Ensure that your dataset is accompanied by documentation that is suitable for your discipline and type of dataset. | Include versioning in all documentation to ensure transparency and encourage re-evaluation.| “Evaluate local descriptive practices and policies using the criteria: Which audiences does this description center? Which audiences does it exclude? For academic archives, this could look like making description more comprehensible for undergraduates, genealogists/family historians, and local community members. For archives collecting Spanish-language material, this could mean considering whether English-language finding aids are serving users. This could also look like minimizing archival jargon.”[^1]|
|"Do not use passive voice when describing oppressive relationships"[^2]| | Make documentation an integral part of your research lifecycle. This ensures that the documentation is representative of all the work undertaken, and all the decisions made.|
