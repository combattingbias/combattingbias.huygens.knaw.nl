# Methodology (including Algorithms)

## Definition
"a systematic deviation in the outcomes of an evaluation process, stemming directly from the specific methods or approaches employed."
 
_Definition source: **Sustainability Directory (2025). [Assessment Methodological Bias](https://energy.sustainability-directory.com/term/data-durability/){:target="_blank"}.**_

**4 - Analyse**

- [Analysing and Interpreting Data](/lifecycle/analyse/#analysing-and-interpreting-data)

## Questions to consider throughout your work
- How might your category choices introduce or amplify bias in ML applications?
- Could your variables create problematic correlations or inferences when used in predictive models?
- How might simplifications in categorization lead to algorithmic discrimination?
- How might missing or unbalanced data within categories affect computational analysis?
- How might your analytical methods themselves introduce bias?
- What assumptions underlie your interpretive frameworks?
