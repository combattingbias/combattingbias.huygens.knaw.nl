## Definition
Uses of produced data that are not as intended by the researcher. 

_Definition source: **Combatting Bias definition** (based on conversations with partner projects)_

## Stakes
_part of: **opacity, discrimination**_

_related to: **multivocality**_

Similar to risk assessments: by considering unintended uses during research, some of these uses could already be mitigated. Noting unintended uses also flags responsibility and accountability to other researchers. 

## Where does it occur in the lifecycle?

**4 - Analyse**

- Analysing and Interpreting Data

**5 - Preserve & Share**

- Contextualise data for external users


## Questions to consider throughout your work
- Can the visualisation be misinterpreted?
- Can the research data be misinterpreted?
- Can the data be used for a different intended purpose (so-called [_function creep_](https://doi.org/10.1080/17579961.2021.1898299))?
- Can any information in your dataset be viewed as misleading?

## Good-better-best practices

| Good | Better | Best|
|---|---|---|
|Make clear in your mission statement what the goal of your research (output) is. | Discuss any unintended uses (and intended uses) in documentation (e.g. mission statement, final publications).| Work at mitigating unintended uses during your research.|
| | | Anticipate unintended use of your dataset by future users and warn against such usage.|
| | | Consider how you convey this knowledge and put it to use (by conceptualising and implementing mitigation strategies) in future data projects. |
