## Definition
Privacy is concerned with the protection of personal data: “any information that relates to an identified or identifiable living individual (data subject).”
 
_Definition source: **European Commission (n.d.). [Data protection explained](https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-protection-explained_en).**_

## Stakes
_part of: **opacity**_

Privacy has many (legal) regulations around it, and is therefore important to consider.  
  

## Where does it occur in the lifecycle?

**2 - Collection**
- Reflect: Assess data storage structure of DMP

## Questions to consider throughout your work
- Is the collected data stored safely?

## Good-better-best practices

| Good | Better | Best|
|---|---|---|
|Follow the principle "As open as possible, as closed as necessary" when it comes to privacy. | Ensure your research data is stored securely and is only accessible to those who need access.| Create a plan for the deletion of sensitive data, if possible.| 
|When working with data from (living) humans, ensure you follow the guidelines of your institutional Ethics Committee. | | Consider 'opening' your sensitive data to select users, either through physical barriers (closed reading rooms) or digital (password login to access).|
|You must receive **informed consent** from all participants before collecting data.| Look into the use of indirect identifiers. | |
|Anonymise your data. | | |
