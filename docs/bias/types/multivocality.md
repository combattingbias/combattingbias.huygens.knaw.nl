## Definition
“An approach to archaeology, but also for historical reasoning, explanation and understanding that accepts a high degree of relativism and thus encourages the contemporaneous articulation of numerous different narratives or parallel discourses."

_Alterative concepts: plurivocality; polyvocality_
 
_Definition source: **Oxford Reference (n.d.). [multivocality](https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100216225_).** Retrieved 30 Jan. 2025.)_

## Stakes
_part of: **discrimination**, **opacity**_

_related to: **collaboration**_

If multivocality is neither considered, nor represented in the publication of research (documentation), it gives an unfair representation of the past and/or present, as there are always parallel discourses present. 
  

## Where does it occur in the lifecycle?

**2 - Collection**

- [Select and curate sources and/or data](/lifecycle/collection/#select-and-curate-sources-andor-data)
- [Create metadata for the data](/lifecycle/collection/#create-metadata-for-the-data)
- [Create usable categories and variables for your dataset](/lifecycle/collection/#create-usable-categories-and-variables-for-your-dataset)

**3 - Process**

- [Annotate your data](/lifecycle/process/#annotate-your-data)

## Questions to consider throughout your work
- Does your data allow for the inclusion of multiple perspectives?
- What sources are you not collecting from - and would they provide different perspectives?
- Does your metadata fairly describe different perspectives that exist?
- Does the metadata of your source (data) do so?
- Do your categories represent complex data adequately?
- Does your annotation represent diversity adequately?

## Good-better-best practices

| Good | Better | Best|
|---|---|---|
|Be aware of different perspectives and voices around your research topic. Discuss this regularly internally with your team.| Include different voices into your metadata and annotations. See: [Collaboration](/bias/types/collaboration).|Consider all the stages in which you can integrate multivocality, starting with the conceptualization of the research project. 
| Explain transparently in documentation (the lack of) multivocality in research, and steps future research may take. | | Work with user groups and seek out user feedback after the publication of the dataset and incorporate feedback into newer versions of the dataset. 
| | | Be aware of activists, projects, organizations and institutions that work with affected communities and can help make your research multivocal. Involve them in the ownership of the project, in name, funding, and/or decentralising knowledge creation and storage.|
