**Description**: A DMP is a roadmap for good data management at every stage of research. It is a **living** document that will reflect changes and updates made to your research.

## When undertaking this task, what should you consider?

[**FAIR**](../bias/types/FAIR.md)

- How do you plan to publish FAIR data?
- Do you foresee any issues with aligning your project with the FAIR principles? Why?

[**Impact**](../bias/types/impact.md)

- In what way would your data harm other persons and the environment? [^1]

[**Ownership**](../bias/types/ownership.md)

- Who (legally) owns the data you will produce?
- How will you acknowledge data contributors and sources?

[**Durability**](../bias/types/durability.md)

- How will you ensure your data remains FAIR in the future, after the project ends?
- What preservation strategies will you implement for long-term accessibility?
- Who will maintain the dataset once the project ends?

## What are good practices in relation to this task?

- Follow online guidelines/templates for writing DMPs. Your institute may already have a template/guidelines that you can use. 

- Use your envisioned dataset documentation templates to guide writing your DMP. This ensures dataset documentation is considered throughout the dataset creation process and allows for more efficient documentation. 
    - This ensures your DMP includes details on version control practices and proposed usages of the created dataset.
    - Examples of dataset documentation are [data-envelopes](https://aclanthology.org/2024.legal-1.9/) and [datasheets (for cultural heritage)](https://openhumanitiesdata.metajnl.com/articles/10.5334/johd.124). 

- Use the the [FAIR Implementation Profile](https://www.go-fair.org/how-to-go-fair/fair-implementation-profile/) questionnaire to guide writing your DMP, specifically with regards to what specifications to consider to make your dataset FAIR compliant. 

- Include how harm to other beings and the environment can be identified and mitigated in a timely manner.[^2]

- Include versioning into your DMP to encourage regular re-evaluation during the project.
