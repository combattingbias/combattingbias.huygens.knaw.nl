## Description
_The **Analyse** stage centres on exploring trends and relationships in your data. This can be done through creation of visualisations and/or statistical analysis._

## Tasks

### Analysing and Interpreting Data

**_When undertaking this task, what should you consider?_**

#### [**Unintended Use**](../bias/types/unintended-use.md)

- Can the visualisation/analysis be misinterpreted?[^2]

#### [**Representation**](../bias/types/representation.md)

- What does the chosen visualisation style highlight and under- and/or misrepresent?[^3]

#### [**Reproducibility**](../bias/types/reproducibility.md)

- Have you documented your analysis process sufficiently for others to reproduce it?
- How are you handling intersectionality in your analysis?
- Do your interpretations risk essentializing complex identities?

#### [**Methodology (including algorithms)**](../bias/types/methodology.md)

- How might your analytical methods themselves introduce bias?
- What assumptions underlie your interpretive frameworks?

**_What are good practices in relation to this task?_**

- Document the shortcomings and possibilities of your analysis

- Highlight these are not the only conclusions that can be drawn from your data, and describe other potential outcomes and uses.

- Include different forms of visualisation, such as word-concept distance or statistics. 

- Develop strategies for communicating uncertainty alongside findings

### Reflect: Assess sufficiency of data collection

**_When undertaking this task, what should you consider?_**

#### [**Silences**](../bias/types/silences.md)

- Are there gaps and/or silences in your data collection process?

_What are good practices in relation to this task?_

- Rethink your data collection practices. Adjust if needed.

- Document decisions made in adjusting (or not adjusting) data collection practice. 

- Document implications of the data collection process on output and the subsequent use of the output.
