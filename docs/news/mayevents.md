     While we’re already busying ourselves with many events, conferences, and workshops happening in June and July, we also want to take some space for reflecting on an eventful month of May for the Combatting Bias project (a <a href="https://tdcc.nl/about-tddc/ssh/" target="_blank">TDCC-SSH</a> and NWO-funded project).

On 13 May, we organised our **project workshop** for our network of collaborators. This was one of the major expected outputs for our project, as a moment to showcase our work as well as collectively think about ways forward. At the same time, as we hope to promote transparency and accessibility as required considerations for responsible research, we wanted to create an event in combination with our workshop. On 12 May, we therefore organised the open-to-all event **_Uncovering Shared Yet Troubled Pasts_**, a presentation panel with Mandy Sanger, Jane Hooper, Lotte Baltussen, and chaired by Britt van Duijvenvoorde. 

We were so pleased with how these events went – below, we’ll recap them and outline our takeaways for the future of this project. 

## 12 May: Uncovering Shared Yet Troubled Pasts

       This panel hosted three researchers and practitioners, Mandy Sanger, Jane Hooper, and Lotte Baltussen, chaired by Britt van Duijvenvoorde. Each of the speakers is working with projects and/or institutions that deal with ‘opening up’ (in the widest sense of the word) a troubled past, in different time periods and regions in the world.
