# Resource List

As we begin the Combatting Bias project, we’re creating a [resource list](docs/Resources and Publications/Resources.md)[^1] to gather and share resources on bias, dataset creation, documentation, and FAIR principles. Our goal is to build a diverse, ever-expanding collection of materials—not just academic papers, but also films, exhibitions, fiction, and more[^2]. We want this list to reflect a wide range of perspectives and approaches to bias.

## The Challenge of “Sorting Things Out”
                                               
We’ve started with broad categories like **Bias**, **Dataset Creation and Documentation**, and **FAIR Principles**, but as we explore, we’re finding that “bias” can represent many interconnected themes, such as:
- Transparency
- Absences/Silences
- Representation
- Discrimination
- Positionality/Situatedness
- Categorisation
- Interpretation 
- Fairness
- Truth?

## Collaboration

While the list is currently open for viewing and suggesting resources, we’re working toward making it more manageable and community-driven in the future. **Have a resource or a better categorisation idea or ways to manage such a repository collectively?** We’d love to hear from you! Send your suggestions to combattingbias[at]gmail[dot]com.
