**Project Kick-Off** | 8 October 2024 <br>
The Combatting Bias project is organising an official kick-off to launch the project to its partner projects and advisors. It will be an interactive 3-hour event where the project and all collaborators have the opportunity to meet, discuss (common) challenges faced in dataset creation in their work, and think about what collaboration will look like. 

The event will be held on 8 October, 14:00-17:00.
