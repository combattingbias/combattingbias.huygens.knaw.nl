# Combatting Bias kicks off

On 8 October 2024, we kicked off the Combatting Bias project at the Huygens Institute in Amsterdam. The event brought together our wide network of partners and advisors, both in-person and online. 

The day began with project introductions and research presentations, highlighting our shared ambition to create FAIR and ethical datasets for the humanities. The diversity of approaches and expertise within our network was immediately apparent, setting the stage for rich discussions. If you're curious about who's involved, you can find short descriptions of our [partner projects](Team/Partners/Partner%20Projects.md) and [advisors](Team/Partners/Advisors.md) on our website.
