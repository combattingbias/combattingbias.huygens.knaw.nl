## Prof. Charles Jeurgens

Charles is professor of archival sciences at the University of Amsterdam. His work bridges historical insights and contemporary challenges in information management and transparency. His expertise will help ensure that the guidelines developed by _Combatting Bias_ are grounded in its historical and social context and address the power dynamics inherent in (archival) data. 

## Jeftha Pattikawa

The DE-BIAS project detects offensive language and suggests alternative language within these collections, leading to more informed wording. Their work on detecting and addressing offensive language will guide the project in developing sensitive and inclusive metadata practices.

**Stevie Nolten** is a researcher working on coloniality and institutional accountability. Apart from research, she is also a councillor for BIJ1 and group chairperson in Utrecht.

**Isabel Beirigo** is a research communications specialist working on the DE-BIAS project and is a member of the working group on decolonisation, at the International Council of Museums (ICOM).

**Monique Groot** is a product manager of research and cultural heritage. 

## Layan Nijem

Layan is the project coordinator for the project Decolonizing South East Asian Sounds (DeCoSEAS). Their focus on non-textual sources of knowledge challenges traditional data paradigms, and will enrich the project with broader methodological perspectives. 

## District Six Museum

The museum, located in the former residential area of District Six in Cape Town, South Africa, was established in 1994 as a tribute to the 60,000 forcibly relocated residents of various races during the 1970s Apartheid era. It not only commemorates this period but also actively participates in the reconstruction of the neighbourhood. These efforts aim to foster a community where dignity, identity, and the coexistence of different races are respected and celebrated. Their experiences in memorialisation and community engagement through the lens of apartheid's history will inform the project's approach to addressing historical injustices and biases.

The two advisors from District Six Museum are:

**Mandy Sanger**, as the Head of Education at the District Six Museum, facilitates youth and community engagement through creative, hands-on experiences. Her work focuses on fostering resilience and solidarity, challenging societal norms of power and privilege, and promoting an egalitarian future through anti-racism programs and reimagining public spaces with a humanising approach.

**Tina Smith**, Head of Collections at the District Six Museum, has played a pivotal role in the development of the museum’s curatorial framework and her work seeks to address ways of rethinking notions of memorialisation.

## Global Data Lab (GDL)
<img src="/static/img/logo_gdl.svg" alt="GDL logo" style="width:100%;">

GDL, situated at the Nijmegen School of Management, Radboud University, is an independent centre focusing on data and research. Utilising over 500 household survey datasets, GDL has created a comprehensive database encompassing information on 35 million individuals across 130+ countries, primarily in low- and middle-income regions. GDL's work involves conducting research and developing specialised databases, indices, and tools for monitoring and analysing societal status and progress. GDL's work on societal status and progress in low- and middle-income countries will inform the project's efforts to create inclusive data guidelines for the social sciences that reflect diverse global contexts and contribute to addressing historical and contemporary inequalities.

**Prof. Natascha Wagner** is a professor of International Economics at the Nijmegen School of Management at Radboud University, Netherlands and the director of the GDL. 

## HAICU
