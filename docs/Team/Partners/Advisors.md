## District Six Museum

The museum, located in the former residential area of District Six in Cape Town, South Africa, was established in 1994 as a tribute to the 60,000 forcibly relocated residents of various races during the 1970s Apartheid era. It not only commemorates this period but also actively participates in the reconstruction of the neighbourhood. These efforts aim to foster a community where dignity, identity, and the coexistence of different races are respected and celebrated. The two advisors from District Six Museum are:

### Mandy Sanger

Her work focuses on fostering resilience and solidarity, challenging societal norms of power and privilege, and promoting an egalitarian future through anti-racism programs and reimagining public spaces with a humanising approach.

### Tina Smith

Tina Smith, Head of Collections at the District Six Museum, has played a pivotal role in the development of the museum’s curatorial framework and her work seeks to address ways of rethinking notions of memorialisation.
