_Combatting Bias_ works closely with partner projects, which will play a pivotal role in data sharing, collaboration, and knowledge exchange. These partner projects have a shared focus on data related to colonialism and slavery and as a practical matter, already deal with:

1. **Dataset Creation:** They specialise in creating and organising data sourced from colonial archives, encompassing named and unnamed individuals, places, and polities across Asia, Africa, and the Americas.

2. **Addressing Historical Imbalances:** The partner projects work to counterbalance archival silences and rectify historiographic imbalances.

3. **Ethical Considerations:** The coalition is deeply committed to addressing ethical dilemmas inherent in creating and (re)presenting data related to colonial histories.

These projects are:

## Slave Voyages

The Slave Voyages project is a comprehensive digital resource that documents the forced transportation of over 12 million enslaved Africans. It combines the Trans-Atlantic and Intra-American slave trade databases, representing decades of collaborative research by international scholars. Developed by a multidisciplinary team, the project features datasets, historical information, and interactive tools. Developed at various universities, the Slave Voyages [website](https://www.slavevoyages.org/) is now hosted at Rice University, serving as a crucial resource for understanding the history and impact of the slave trade.

## Slave Registers

The Slave Registers project is an extensive [database](https://www.nationaalarchief.nl/onderzoeken/zoekhulpen/suriname-slavenregisters-1816-1863) that integrates nineteenth and twentieth century source information about formerly enslaved persons in the Dutch colonies in the Americas. It is a collaboration between the Radboud University in Nijmegen, Anton de Kom University in Suriname, the National Archives of the Netherlands and Suriname, heritage organisations and crowdsourcing initiatives. Building on this foundation, researchers from both universities are now focusing on the creation of a database of the Suriname population between 1830-1950, in the project [Legacies of Bondage](https://www.ru.nl/onderzoek/onderzoeksprojecten/legacies-of-bondage). This will shed light on not only the social processes and diversity of a colonial society, but also the impact of unfree labour on following generations, and the interaction of different groups of migrants in Suriname.

## Exploring Slave Trade in Asia (ESTA)

ESTA is building a [database](https://exploringslavetradeinasia.com/) that reconstructs the historic slave trade in the Indian Ocean and Maritime Asia region. By highlighting this region of the slave trade, it stimulates new research, as well as connections and more global perspectives to the global trade of enslaved people. The database includes the reconstruction of a variety of forced labour transportations, such as the commodified and legalized slave trade to "illegal" (private) human trafficking, and tributary exchanges between polities to penal slavery. It is through the inclusion of all these forms of bonded labour that global connections can be drawn and the structures of slave trade can be understood. 


## GLOBALISE

The [GLOBALISE](https://globalise.huygens.knaw.nl/) project is building a digital infrastructure of the Dutch East India Company Archives, to make these archives accessible to the public and researchers. These archives provide insight into early modern societies in Asia, Africa, and Australia. As few archival sources of the time exist of these regions, the archives hold valuable information that illuminates their global interactions with other areas. GLOBALISEâ€™s mission is to empower researchers and the general public to explore these archives and write new, inclusive histories. In order to do so, they are working with AI methods to transcribe over 5 million handwritten pages, extracting key entities and events from the text, and creating reference guides to support their data.
