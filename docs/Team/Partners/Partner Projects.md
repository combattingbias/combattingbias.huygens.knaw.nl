_Combatting Bias_ works closely with partner projects, which will play a pivotal role in data sharing, collaboration, and knowledge exchange. These partner projects have a shared focus on data related to colonialism and slavery and as a practical matter, already deal with:

1. **Dataset Creation:** They specialise in creating and organising data sourced from colonial archives, encompassing named and unnamed individuals, places, and polities across Asia, Africa, and the Americas.

2. **Addressing Historical Imbalances:** The partner projects work to counterbalance archival silences and rectify historiographic imbalances.

3. **Ethical Considerations:** The coalition is deeply committed to addressing ethical dilemmas inherent in creating and (re)presenting data related to colonial histories.

These projects are:

## Slave Voyages

The Slave Voyages project is a comprehensive digital resource that documents the forced transportation of over 12 million enslaved Africans. It combines the Trans-Atlantic and Intra-American slave trade databases, representing decades of collaborative research by international scholars. Developed by a multidisciplinary team, the project features datasets, historical information, and interactive tools. Developed at various universities, the Slave Voyages [website](https://www.slavevoyages.org/) is now hosted at Rice University, serving as a crucial resource for understanding the history and impact of the slave trade.
