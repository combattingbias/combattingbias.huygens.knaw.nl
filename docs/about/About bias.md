Central to our project - and to the SSH field, we argue - is the need to scrutinise the term 'bias': what do we mean when we write or speak about bias?

Instead of a straight-forward definition with a straight-forward solution to the 'problem' of bias, we found that bias is often used as a heuristic, a short-hand to refer to a collection of different yet interrelated concepts. 

So, in order to get to an answer to our question that is actionable and reusable, we are currently developing a 'bias taxonomy'.
