As we begin the Combatting Bias project, weâ€™re creating a resource list[^1] to gather and share resources on bias, dataset creation, documentation, and FAIR principles. Our goal is to build a diverse, ever-expanding collection of materialsâ€”not just academic papers, but also films, exhibitions, fiction, and more[^2]. We want this list to reflect a wide range of perspectives and approaches to bias.
